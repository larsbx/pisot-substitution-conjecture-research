"""Exploratory: types of the Sirvent--Solomyak overlap graph G_O(T, x(W))
for the pair (T, T - beta^n x(W)), n >= 0, where T is the tiling of a fixed
point u of a prolongable power tau = sigma^q and W is a prefix of u, compared
with the vertex types of the seed-patch graph O_sigma.

Level-0 overlap types of (u, S^k u), k = |W|, are enumerated from the factors
of u found in a long prefix (an exploratory, not certified, factor set), then
closed under the exact inflation of `OverlapGraph`.  Productivity of an
overlap depends only on its type, so
    types(G_O) subset of types(O_sigma)
would transfer seed-patch productivity to the literature graph.
