"""Independent Python oracle for finite bad-overlap obstruction extraction.

The canonical executable implementation is ``mojo/psc/overlap_obstruction.mojo``.
This module intentionally works against the public ``OverlapGraph`` shape
(``states``, ``adj``, ``capped``, ``nonproductive()``), so tests can also use
small synthetic graphs that isolate the graph-theoretic contract.
