"""Radius-``m`` symbolic collars of seed-patch occurrences (independent oracle).

Canonical implementation: ``mojo/psc/overlap_collar.mojo``.  An occurrence
path from a swap seed is an actual pair of tiles in the inflated periodic
patches ``sigma^n((ab)^Z)`` and ``sigma^n((ba)^Z)``.  Its radius-``m``
collar records the ``m`` letters on each side of each tile in its patch.
The collar of a child occurrence is a function of the parent's collar and the
child indices (the collar recursion), so the collared occurrence graph at any
radius is finite and projects onto the seed-patch overlap graph.

Three finite diagnostics are defined on it.  An *unresolved collision* is a
collared state reached by occurrences with different one-step ancestry
(parent letters and child indices): the collar does not determine the parent
occurrence.  The *separation radius* is the least radius with no unresolved
collision; a survivor at the tested radius is retained, not explained away.
The *lift* of an affine pump replays an occurrence-labelled cycle on the
fibre over its first state and reports the eventual period of the collar.
A collision that no radius separates has a structural source: a seed pair
whose iterated patch collapses to a proper power, hence to a periodic word
with two parsings into images (``patch_power_level``).
None of this proves a recognizability radius for the periodic patches, nor
overlap productivity.
