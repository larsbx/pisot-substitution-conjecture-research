"""Discrepancy of inflated swap seeds and of reachable balanced-pair states.

For a seed (ab, ba) and a level n, the *swap walk* is the prefix-difference
walk of the balanced pair (sigma^n(ab), sigma^n(ba)):

    Delta_n(j) = parikh(sigma^n(ab)[:j]) - parikh(sigma^n(ba)[:j]).

Every state of B_sigma is a block of the reduction of some (sigma^n(ab),
sigma^n(ba)) cut at a zero return, so its own prefix-difference walk is a
segment of a swap walk starting at 0.  Hence

    Disc(T) <= max_j ||Delta_n(j)||_inf

for every state T at depth n below the seed (ab, ba).  The bound
``swap_walk_sup`` is what the bounded-discrepancy theorem
(docs/source-imports/issue-45/g1b1-bounded-discrepancy-reconstruction.md)
proves to be uniformly bounded in n; this module only evaluates it exactly.
