"""Oracle constants shared with tests/test_substitution_dynamics.mojo in
larsbx/finite-math-kernels (vendored here as mojo/substitution_dynamics/).

The Mojo package is alphabet-generic; the Python oracle is the independent
reference. Both must report the same automaton counts off the alphabet-3
corpus. The oracle uses 1-based letters, the Mojo package 0-based.
