"""Oracle constants shared with mojo/tests/test_integer_vector.mojo.

The canonical kernel is `mojo/psc/integer_vector.mojo`; this is the independent
cross-check. Both derive the same two checksums over the same 348 distinct
incidence matrices of the alphabet-3 PIP corpus, by different implementations in
different languages, so a divergence in either shows up as a number rather than
as a silence.

The two sides are not identical in contract, and that asymmetry is asserted
here too: Python's `int` is arbitrary precision, so the oracle returns an exact
answer where the 64-bit kernel raises. The kernel is exact or absent; the
oracle is the reference for what "exact" was.
