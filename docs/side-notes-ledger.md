# Side-notes ledger

**Status:** live, append-only working ledger. It records side findings so that
no session re-spends cycles on them: refuted mechanisms, redirected routes,
specimens already settled by the literature, withdrawn figures, finite
observations, and tooling pitfalls. It changes no claim status; each entry
points to the note or receipt that carries the evidence. Policy:
`AGENTS.md`, "Record side findings".

Entry format: date · finding · evidence locator. Add entries at the end of the
right section; correct an entry by adding a dated correction under it, never
by deleting it.

  on target-free PIP occurrence transitions is false: replayed cycle
  `396,820` has hub word `1,1` and offset `0,1,0`; its first edge selects an
  actual interior child. The support is productive, so this is a local

## 2. Redirected routes (no lever there; see the decision)

- 2026-10-05 · The `CU` / one-tile route cannot reach #139, and Proposition LC
  says why in terms of objects rather than counts: a `CU`-failure *is* a
  prefix-vs-interior periodic pair, whose centre is a vertex of one tiling of
  infinite level and interior to every level tile of the other — hence
  **never** a common vertex, by construction. So these pairs are a forced,
  abundant family (10,584 on the corpus, on 2,760 specimens) that costs
  nothing: G1 holds on the whole standing corpus anyway. The genuine
  obstruction to #139 is the **interior-vs-interior** pair of Theorem B, where
  the centre is a vertex of neither tiling and a shared vertex elsewhere is
  open — `psc.periodic_pair` and PPVC. Spend #139 effort there. The leftmost
  chain's remaining use is Corollary LC5. ·
  `p1b-leftmost-chain-periodic-pair-2026-10-05.md` §8b

- 2026-10-03 · Barge's (W) / beta-numeration monotonicity as a route to PPVC:
  it is a consequence of pure discrete spectrum, not independent of it. ·

- 2026-10-04 · Adelic coverage for T2 on the catch-up-free class: needs the
  multiplicity-one window property, which pure discrete spectrum gives; the
  class's arithmetic does not lower the bar. · same, §5.6e
- 2026-10-04 · Vertex-sheet alignment as a PDS-free lever: under SC_all a
  common vertex of two `Phi^r`-fixed tilings forces a common tile (Lemma VT),
  so it is tile coincidence. · same, §5.6f
- 2026-10-04 · Recoding a catch-up-free `|det M| = 2` substitution to a
  unimodular one on three letters: impossible, `|det M| = |N(beta)|` is an

  E letter and a length-1 image: powers provably never work (Lemma B); no

## 3. Settled by the literature (do not target with new machinery)

- 2026-10-04 · Specimens with a power or common-prefix/suffix conjugate in
  Barge's 2016 class or its mirror have pure discrete spectrum, hence PPVC
  and G1: 1,248 of the 4,554 corpus specimens, 6,336 of the 24,486 of total
  length ≤ 8; in the catch-up-free class 78 of 210 and 174 of 654. List them
  with `pixi run barge-class-census [total]`. Rests on the imported Barge
  (2016) and, for PPVC, on Theorem S (unreviewed). ·

- 2026-10-04 · PDS ⇒ all-pairs prefix strong coincidence for irreducible
  Pisot substitutions: Akiyama–Lee 2014, Corollary 4.5; in the non-unit case
  the height-group step is Theorem R (repository, unreviewed), since Sing's
  2006 thesis is not retrievable (Bielefeld repository refuses access). Do
  not re-search; consequence FP ⟺ PDS. ·
  `pds-strong-coincidence-literature-gate-2026-10-04.md`

- 2026-10-07 · Theorem K's family has no power or rotation in Barge's PDS
  class or its mirror: the initial (and final) letters of `sigma^n` on
  `o, y, z` alternate `(y, o, o)` / `(o, y, y)`, never injective, never
  constant, no common first letter. Do not test Theorem K's members against

- 2026-10-07 · **Bounded `Z_2` closes the tails for every `Delta`.** With
  `Z_2 <= cap` the members' run patterns are finitely many and fully
  revealed (`w_1` or `u` beginning with `z`, at most `Z_2 + s` z-runs;
  `w_2` at most `cap`), symbolic in `Delta` and the run lengths; split by
  the value of `Z_2` (pieces above `cap` left out) each closes:
  `s = +1, Z_2 <= 1`: 24 patterns, 51 regions, 3 s; `Z_2 <= 2`: 60
  patterns, 748 regions, 45 s; `s = −1, Z_2 <= 2`: 20 patterns, 92 regions,
  2.5 s. Days of the open-tail run tree had not closed what this
  decomposition closes in seconds: decompose by the Pisot factor first.

- 2026-10-07 · The Z_2-cap route, measured beyond cap 3. s = −1, Z_2 <= 4
  does not close: of its patterns, `zy | yzyzyz`, `zy | yzyzyzy`,
  `zy | yzyzyzyz` keep 9, 36 and 10 open regions after the finishers
  (Fourier-Motzkin bounds, implied equalities, point-by-point decision up
  to 2,000 points): the leftovers are finite boxes of up to ~18,000 points
  (`n2` in `[20, 42]`, `n4, n6 <= 27`), slices with large constants
  inherited from earlier carvings, where certificates found elsewhere do
  not extend. Cost per cap: 3 s, 45 s, 82 s for the closed caps, hours at
  cap 4. Witness shapes at `s = −1, Delta = −2`, `|w_1| <= 6` (scratch
  census of distinct members): `Z_2 = 2`: 24 members, 20 shapes; `Z_2 = 3`:
  186, 42; `Z_2 = 4`: 470, 86. The leading shapes at `Z_2 = 3` and `4` are
  the same level-3 paths (`w_1` read from its start, `w_2` from its end),
  so the bulk is uniform in `Z_2`, but the number of shapes grows with it:
  no finite named-path lemma covers all `Z_2` from this census. ·
  `kernel/odd_letter_family_certificate.mojo` (`zcap_cover`); scratch
  `zshape.py`

- 2026-10-07 · Unbounded `Z_2`: Lemma P1 is needed only **linearly**. At
  the McCormick corner `(floor, b_lo)` (`a = Z_2`, `b = |Delta| − 1`) it
  implies one affine form, `2 Y_2 >= Z_2 + 2 Delta − 8` (`s = +1`,
  `Delta >= 2`, `Z_2 >= 3`) and `2 Y_1 >= Z_2 + 3|Delta| − 4` (`s = −1`,
  `|Delta| >= 2`, `Z_2 >= 4`) (`z_floor_forms`). On that polyhedral region
  every non-crossing pair tested is coincident, PIP or not: exhaustive
  `|w_1| <= 9` (`s = +1`: 453 pairs; `s = −1`, `|w_2| <= 13`: in progress)
  holds only PIP pairs (non-PIP region points need longer words), so a
  seeded sample of the **non-PIP** part (seed 1, 150 draws each sign,
  `Z_2 <= 8`, `|Delta| <= 6`; seed 2, `s = +1`, 400 draws, `Z_2 <= 14`,
  `Delta <= 10`) found every pair coincident by level 4 (draw budget 200
  per wanted pair, not exhausted). Outside it, non-PIP pairs do fail (e.g.
  `w_1 = z^k y^3`, `w_2 = z^(k−1)`, `k >= 6`: no tile by level 7), so the
  quadratic is replaced, not dropped. Consequence: the open-tail cover needs
  no McCormick staircase; `2 zfloor s delta floor budget` runs it.
  · `kernel/odd_letter_family_certificate.mojo` (`z_floor_forms`,
  `cover_pattern_guided(z_floor=)`); scratch `lin.py`, `linsamp.py`
  Correction (2026-10-07): the `s = −1` exhaustive run "in progress" never
  started (launched from the wrong directory); the `s = −1` exhaustive figure
  is `|w_1| <= 7`, `|w_2| <= 11`: 1,395 region pairs, all PIP, all coincident
  by level 5. The seed-2 `s = −1` sample (400 wanted, `Z_2 <= 14`,
  `|Delta| <= 10`) was killed out of memory (10.5 GB: `first_tile` expands
  whole level-6 words), so it reports nothing; `s = −1` rests on seed 1 only.

- 2026-10-07 · Unbounded `Z_2`, the z_floor cover run: **what blocks is a
  product inside the certificates, not Lemma P1's staircase.** (1) The
  open-tail trees `2 zfloor 1 2 3 5000 8` and `2 zfloor -1 -2 4 5000 8`
  refine their roots and first children (open regions 12, 59 and 58, 184;
  10–30 min per pattern) and were stopped after ~1 h without a verdict. The
  root's open regions are opaque-tail regions with no certificate, so z_floor
  leaves §3i's doubly open chain where it was. Re-running the cells
  `(+1, 2)` and `(−1, −2)` after the cover-leak fixes
  (`2 cell ±1 ±2 30000 8 plain`) walks the same chain: no verdict after 70
  min. (2) Fully revealed patterns with every run length symbolic, so `Z_2`
  and `Delta` unbounded, under z_floor (scratch `zruns`, budget 5,000):
  `s = +1`, `Z_2 >= 3`, `Delta >= 2`: all 17 patterns with `u` of at most 2
  runs and `w_2` of at most 4 runs close (at most 28 regions, 7 s each)
  except `zy +y^(2+e) | zyzy`, with no verdict after 40 min. `s = −1`,
  `Z_2 >= 4`, `Delta <= −2`: 11 close; `zy | yz` and `zy | yzy` end with 1
  and 2 open regions, and `zy | yzyz` gave no verdict after 25 min.
  (3) The open region of `zy | yz` is `w_1 = z^a y^b`,
  `w_2 = y^(b+2+e) z^(a+1)`, `Delta = −2 − e`. Its witnesses
  `(y, z, −e_o) → (y, z, a e_z − (a+2) e_y) → (y, y, −4 e_o) → (y, y, 0)`
  have `M d = (−4, 2a − 2b + ae, −a)`: the `a b` terms cancel. So the
  level-3 positions `k` (in `y^b`) and `m` (in `y^(b+2+e)`) need
  `k − m = 2b − 2a − ae`. That product is Lemma P1's own:
  `f(−1) = ae + a − 2b + 2`, and `k − m = 2 − a − f`. The certificate is
  affine in `(a, b, e, q = ae)` but not in `(a, b, e)`, so lifting by run
  offsets only carves slices (polynomial line mode's "degree-2 part does
  not vanish"). This one family, with the level-4 offset `t` in `0..2`,
  verifies on 1,134 of the 4,913 members with `a <= 11`, `b < 80`, `e <= 8`
  (brute recomputation, scratch `qcert.py`). In line mode,
  `M (c_0 + lambda (e_z − e_y)) = M c_0 + lambda (0, −Delta, −s)` with
  `lambda` affine and `Delta = D ± e`, so every product a line certificate
  needs has the form `n_j e` (`e` included). **Next:** lift the cover by
  the coordinates `q_j = n_j e`. Lemma P1 then becomes exactly affine, so
  no McCormick wedge is left; certificates become affine; regions are
  polyhedra in `(n, q)` whose real points satisfy `q = n e`, under the
  envelope `q_j >= lo_j e + lo_e n_j − lo_j lo_e`. Do not spend more budget
  on z_floor trees or on fixed-`Delta` cells with opaque tails. ·

- 2026-10-07 · **The q-lift closes the `s = −1` tail leaf `zy | yz`**
  (`Delta = −2 − e <= −2`, `Z_2 >= 4`): `2 qlift -1 -2 4 5000 zy 0 yz 0`
  ends with 104 regions, 35 certified (20 by polynomial paths lifted over
  `(n, q)`), 6 cut, 34 without a real member, **0 open**, in ~50 s; the
  plain z_floor cover of the same leaf leaves 1 open region of 16. Three
  things were needed besides the lift itself, each a finding: (1) the
  point search must reach the path at all: with offset bound 3 it cannot
  pass `(y, y, −4 e_o)`, and with the line offset bounded it cannot pass
  `(0, −(a+2), a)` once `a > 3`, so the q-lift searches with bound 4 off
  the line and the line position free (`search_witness_line(line_cap=)`);
  (2) the lift must not solve a line coordinate to the point's constant
  (that pins `lambda = a` and carves the slice `a = const`, an endless
  staircase), and among lifts it prefers one whose end offset is zero over
  `(n, q)` (`lift_path_poly(lift=)`); (3) regions without a real point are
  settled exactly when `e` is bounded, by `search_point` on the forms with
  `e` fixed (`_point_search`). Beyond `zy | yz` no verdict after ~15 min
  (budget 5,000, runs stopped): `zy | yzy` walks a staircase in `a` (each
  lifted path carries a bound `a <= const`; 1,293 regions, 11 open so
  far), `zy | yzyz` reports regions open, mostly with no real point found
  (159 of 812 regions so far), and `s = +1` `zy +y^(2+e) | zyzy` (Delta >= 2,
  Z_2 >= 3) walks a staircase in one run length (187 regions, none open). ·

- 2026-10-07 · The q-lift's staircases are gone and its no-point regions are
  refuted exactly; **`zy | yzy` now ends with 1 open region, and the q-lift
  closes 2 more `s = +1` patterns in the sweep.** Four additions, all under
  `q_lift` only (flag-off output byte-identical): (1) extent-aware lift
  selection: `lift_path_poly` ranks children by whether the state is affine
  over `(n, q)` and returns the complete lift with the largest `lift_key`
  (number of real probe points of the region, `probe_points`, where the
  carving forms and the zero end offset hold, then lowest offset cost);
  `_poly_carve` lets the tree lift compete with `solve_lift` by that key, and
  `_implied_equality` is substituted eagerly. The staircases came from lifts
  that copy a coordinate of the base point into an offset (pinning `a` in
  `zy | yzy`, one run length in `zy +y^(2+e) | zyzy`). (2) RLT cuts
  (`product_lift.rlt_forms`): `(e − lo_e) g >= 0` and `(hi_e − e) g >= 0`
  for every assumption `g` over `n` alone, expanded with `n_k e = q_k`.
  (3) An exact phase-1 LP (`psc/farkas_lp.mojo`, Bland's rule over
  `finite_exact.Q`) whose answer counts only through a Farkas vector checked
  exactly (`y >= 0`, `yᵀA <= 0`, `yᵀc < 0`), used where a region gets no
  base point; kernel Fourier–Motzkin keeps redundant rows and hits its
  4,000-row cap even on 3 live variables. (4) `_value_split`: a variable
  whose range is bounded by checked certificates is split into its values,
  an exact partition. Measured (budget 5,000): `sweep.sh`, r1 = r2 = 4, 300

  timeouts (was 25 / 1 / 0 / 10): `zy | yz` closes in 42 regions, 10 s (was
  104, 49 s), and `zy | yzy` went from timeout to open. The other 69
  patterns kept their verdicts; every remaining timeout outside `zyz | yz`
  is killed inside the plain cover, so the q-lift never runs on it (this
  includes `zy +y^(2+e) | zyzy`, which the q-lift alone closes in 17
  regions, 3 s). Single runs (`2 qlift -1 -2 4 5000 zy 0 … 0`, `timeout

  crossing, 2 cut, 58 not member), **1 open**, 89 s, terminating; `zy |
  yzyz` timed out at 1,200 s at region #1293 with 14 open without a real
  point, 3 open without a certificate and 10 value splits traced. **Open:**
  `zy | yzy`'s region is LP-feasible over `(n, q)` with no bounded variable;
  at each fixed `e` it has `n_0 = 3`, `n_1` in `[2e + 11, 2e + 13]`, `n_4` in
  `[e − 1, e]` and no integer point for `e <= 60`, so it needs `e`-parametric
  integer reasoning (a split on an affine form such as `n_1 − 2e`, or
  `e`-parametric Fourier–Motzkin). `zy | yzyz`'s no-certificate regions hold
  real points; their liftable paths sit at depth 4–5, which the shared
  5,000-node point-path enumeration in `_poly_carve` never reaches (0 paths
  at 5,000 nodes, 401 at 2,000,000), so they need a larger or lazy

  `v + c e >= 0` kept) partition the real points. The previous round's
  diagnosis was off: on that region's polyhedron over `(n, q)` no form
  `n_k − c e` (`k` in `{0, 1, 4}`, `c` in `−1..3`) is bounded both ways,
  `n_1 − 2e` included, since `q` is free of `n e` there. What bounds it is
  the envelope of the probe (`n_0 >= 4` raises the McCormick floor of
  `q_0`): `n_0 >= 4` and `n_0 <= 2` are each refuted with their envelopes,

  refuted outright. `zy | yz` (42 regions, 0 open, 12 s), `zy +y^(2+e) | zyzy` (17,

  `zy | yzyz` still times out (`timeout 900`: region #1037, none open yet,
  3 value splits; the old cover reaches #1075 in the same time with none

  allowed for `sigma`, and takes offset integrality from the cycle equation.
  The ledger's new set-of-sets `Requires` with existential discharge is sound
  and no route establishes anything from nothing. Two findings of that audit

  any two distinct letters fixed by the first-letter map are eventually
  coincident, so case (i) of #138's aligned template is eliminated on the whole
  class. Three things worth not rediscovering. (1) `p, q, r` sit only in the
  bottom row of `M`, so `det M`, `f(1)` and `f(-1)` are all **affine** in them,
  and `|det M| = 2` is a linear Diophantine condition that fixes one
  parameter. (2) The Pisot necessary conditions `f(1) < 0`, `f(-1) < 0`
  (Lemma P1) predict every line's PIP range *exactly* — e.g. B's line
  `(n, 0, 1)` has `f(-1) = n - 12`, which is why it stops at `n = 11` — so no
  witness lemma is needed on the lines, only on the 2-dimensional bulk. (3) The
  bulk falls to three explicit witness lemmas, each a one-step cancellation of
  a small Parikh discrepancy by offsets that differ by one inside the next

  not rediscovering: (1) *constant-offset* witness paths suffice — every
  `gamma_l` along the path is a parameter-free vector, so `M gamma` is affine
  and validity on a whole cone is affine identities plus coefficient-sign
  inequalities (`psc.cone_witness`); (2) with that, every bulk quadrant of the
  swap family is **one** cone, and the level-4 infinite lines are cones too —
  hand-found lemmas were the bottleneck, not the mathematics; (3) the search
  re-finds Theorem E's L_D with the lemma's own position `p + 3`, so the
  machinery should be tried first on any new linear-exponent family. It does

  two images are short, which forces a letter 3-cycle and Barge–Diamond). None

  lag `c (Delta + s)` (`M(e_z − e_y) = −delta`). What works is **Lemma X**
  (monotone paths crossing at their endpoints meet; weak end allowed when a
  letter follows), which reads endpoints only and so crosses opaque tails,

  suffix the revealed runs a certificate needs grow with length (to 7 at

  `impose_nonneg` + lifted base-point certificates) closes what blind
  splitting could not: Theorem Λ, the whole cell `(+1, 1)`. **Base points
  must be generic**: from the origin, certificates carve slices
  (`n_0 = 0`) and the cover peels one value at a time; with every variable 2,
  they exploit accidental equalities (`2 n_0 = n_3 + n_6`), and one carve split
  into 8,307 + 35,040 regions. Distinct primes `2, 3, 5, …` fixed both

  `Prover` in `psc/cone_witness.mojo`) replace decomposition in the guided
  cover. Pitfalls met on the way, each now a regression: the verifiers' end
  tests asked the offset to be *identically* zero, which a carved region
  never makes it (they now ask the prover for `= 0` on the region); a form
  tightened by its gcd (`tighten`, Chvátal–Gomory, same integer points) is
  only re-provable with a multiplier (`f − 2 T >= 0`), so the prover reads
  multipliers off coefficient ratios; the base-point walk into a region
  overflowed `Int` and lifted a certificate at a garbage point (now capped,
  and a carve whose inside misses its own base point raises). Complements of
  carves are mostly *empty*, and often only through three assumptions at
  once; pairwise sums missed them and the raise-only walk found no point, so
  they were reported open (412 of them in `zyz* +y | yzy*`). Sums of up to
  three assumptions, integer bound propagation (`propagate_bounds`) and a
  local search on total violation took that pattern to 0 open (3,536
  regions). **Finite observation, not to repeat:** in the symbolic tail cell
  `s = +1`, `Delta = 1 + e`, point-wise McCormick quadrants do not converge:
  with `a_0 = 2, b_0 = b(p)` the base points climb `e ≈ 23, 701, 22397,
  716669` (×32 per step), and once points are walked into regions the cuts
  step `e` by one (slopes 23, 24, 25, …). For fixed `Z_2` the non-PIP set
  `(Z_2 − 1) e >= 2 Y_2 + 4` is a half-space, but over all `Z_2` it is not
  polyhedral, so finitely many cuts always leave wedges holding non-PIP
  points with `Z_2, e` both unbounded: a finite tail cover needs
  certificates valid on those non-PIP points too, not finer cuts.
  Certificate-before-cut (`cut_first = False`) does not converge at 5,000

  **Not the mathematics:** in a seeded sample (seed 1, 400 draws,
  `|w_2| <= 10`, `Delta <= 12`; `xlev`, scratch) of `s = +1` non-crossing
  members, every coincidence level is `<= 5`, and `<= 4` for `Delta >= 4`;
  members per `Delta` settle at about 63. Past a threshold depending on
  `(u, w_2)`, the shared tile's path is the same for every `Delta`, its
  `o`-side digit counted from the *end* of `y^Delta` (e.g. `zyzy y^Delta |
  zyy` at level 3 for all `Delta >= 2`), so the certificate is affine in
  `Delta`. **Not hidden Pisot constraints:** for `s = +1`, `f(1) < 0` is the
  whole Pisot condition (exact `pisot`, 5,680 of 5,680 points of
  `Y_2, Z_2 < 30`, `Delta < 30`), and 3,100 of them have `Z_2, Delta >= 2`.
  **It is the cover:** line mode works in fixed-`Delta` cells because
  `M (e_z − e_y) = (0, −Delta, −s)` is constant there; with `Delta = 1 + e`
  symbolic a variable line coefficient makes `M gamma` quadratic, which line
  mode refuses, and point-wise lifting from small-`e` base points carves
  `e`-bounded slices. Uniform McCormick corners `(k, 0)` cut `{Z_2 >= k,
  (k − 1) e >= 2 Y_2 + 4}` with no staircase but leave wedges. Also: the
  non-tail cells never fell back to a non-member base point (now they do),
  and carve complements were mostly empty (dropping implied forms and empty
  complements took `zyz* | yzy* +zzz` from 15,612 regions to 3,441). ·

  quadratic cases (s = +1 tail, 3,000 regions): states agreed, offsets did
  not. Building candidates from the point's own step (its offsets anchored at
  either end, or solved to hold a coordinate) gives polynomial certificates,

  degree-2 part does not vanish, i.e. the certificate holds on a slice, which
  a finite cover cannot use. Also: the fixed cell `(+1, 2)` does not close

  rest carries `f <= −1`. (2) A region whose assumptions pin every

  rejection sampling repeats members; a "dominant" level-4 shape inside
  `y^Delta` (72% of 300 draws at every `Delta` in 6..20) is one family:

  `sigma(y) = t y^r s_y` with the four endings in `{x, c}`. The lemma behind it
  is worth keeping: `|O| <= 2`, because all three letters odd forces every
  image to have length exactly two, hence every column sum 2, hence Perron root
  the rational number 2, contradicting irreducibility (checked independently:
  no nonnegative 3x3 matrix with all column sums 2 is PIP). Two consequences:
  the 18 catch-up-free corpus specimens with `|O| = 1` cannot carry case (i) of
  the template at all, and the alternating template forces `sigma(a) = b` or

  throughout. The finding worth not recomputing: **the tail does not move.**
  The level-4 to level-7 counts are identical at all three budgets (8, 2, 2, 2)
  while only levels 2 and 3 grow, so the hard cases do not scale with the
  parameters. The 14 members of level >= 4 are the same 14 every time, form 7

  verdict: a member outside the range is uncovered, and the cap column is

  alternating-E template the square is the identity — so all three
  sub-templates become the case where both letters of a bad edge are
  `h`-fixed. Every hypothesis transfers (`sigma^2` is PIP because `beta^2` is
  still cubic; the good pair survives by raising the level; a `sigma^2`-child
  is a `sigma`-grandchild). Certificate: 36/36 viable endpoint/good-edge

  coincident segments that start at the same point — exactly the aligned
  configuration — but the pair it hands over is whichever maximality gives, and

  open. Negative control worth keeping: eventual coincidence is stable under

- 2026-10-05 · Vendoring review caught shared machine-integer and governance
  defects beyond green consumer CI. FMK #63 repairs checked products and
  signed-minimum GCD refusal, exact support-based primitivity, alternative-route
  closure and executable-source coverage. All twelve packages now match landed
  commit `360bc90c27893900d30718e42d61d14ce255e530`; the boundary-synchronization
  wrapper propagates upstream refusal. ·

- 2026-10-06 · PSC's substitution application and powers now come from the
  vendored `Substitution.apply` / `apply_n`: the second `apply_substitution`
  in `oa_overlap_types` and `one_tile._power` are deleted, and
  `legal_tower.apply_substitution_n` and `dumont_thomas.power_substitution`
  delegate. The alphabet-generic callers keep the trusted (unvalidated)
  constructor; the alphabet-3 callers keep `bpa.sigma3`'s abort, at depth 0
  still unconsulted. `periodic_pair._image` stays: its word cap refuses
  mid-construction, which `apply_n` cannot. Claim receipts and the full Mojo
  test log are byte-identical before and after. · `kernel/psc/legal_tower.mojo`;
  `kernel/run_tests.sh`
- 2026-10-06 · `pisot.is_primitive(Mat3)` now delegates to the vendored
  `integer_matrix.is_primitive` (Boolean support powers). The old body
  multiplied real powers `M^1..M^5` with unchecked `Mat3.__mul__`, so a
  matrix with entries large enough to wrap could be misjudged; on every
  matrix whose fifth power fits a machine integer (all incidence matrices
  here) the verdicts agree, as `test_boundary_sync` already pinned. The
  vendored test raises only on a dimension mismatch, impossible for a
  `Mat3`, so the view aborts there. `periodic_pair._checked_mat_mul` is
  replaced by the checked `integer_matrix.matmul`: it raises exactly when
  the old one did, though in a contrived case with two overflowing entries
  the message may name addition where the old named multiplication, or the
  reverse (loop order i,k,j against i,j,k). · `kernel/psc/pisot.mojo`;

- 2026-10-06 · The 2026-10-04 session-probe replay pointed `MOJO_DIR` at the
  retired `mojo/`; repointed to `kernel/`. All five Mojo probes compile
  unchanged against the current APIs and reproduce the archived results
  (vc_try radii 29,17,18 / 61,337 states / 716 recurrent; closure 276 + 72;
  diagonal 1,080,828 / 1,153,308 of 1,154,040, 180/30; direct 4170 of 4344,
  29,712 vertices), compared against the README index (the archived
  `rerun_*.out` files were never committed; the fresh ones carry new
  timings and were not written back). ·
  `archive/2026-10-04/session-probes/probes/rerun.sh`
- 2026-10-06 · `psc.real_root_sign` now builds its Tarski query on the
  vendored `qpoly` (`normalize`, `derivative`, `mul`, `remainder`, `neg`,
  `evaluate`, `variation_difference`); its `poly_trim`, `poly_deriv`,
  `poly_mul` and `poly_rem` are deleted. `tarski_query`, `count_real_roots`,
  `isolate_real_roots` and `sign_at_isolated_root` stay: `qpoly` has no Tarski
  query and isolates only the largest root. One semantic difference: the old
  helpers raised on a rejected rational, `qpoly` aborts (via `q_is_zero`), so
  `tarski_query` now checks its inputs are accepted and raises first; accepted
  rationals stay accepted under every operation used. Runtime unchanged:
  13,530 `sign_at_isolated_root` calls take 15.7 s on each side;
  `overlap_contracting_census` 615/615 s before, 647/614 s after;
  `vertex_coincidence_census` 791/647 s before, 855/700 s after (run-to-run
  noise is about 20%), output byte-identical. · `kernel/psc/real_root_sign.mojo`;
  `kernel/tests/test_overlap_contracting.mojo`
- 2026-10-06 · `psc.pisot` and `psc.pisot_screen` take the derivative,
  negation, gcd and Cauchy root bound from the vendored `qpoly`;
  `poly_derivative`, `cauchy_bound` (`3 + max floor|p_k/p_n|`, a looser
  bound than `qpoly.root_bound`'s `1 + max |p_k|/|p_n|`; only ever an
  enclosing interval, so no count changes), `pisot_screen.poly_gcd` and
  `int_cauchy_bound` are deleted. Kept local after measurement: `poly_eval`
  (unrolled; `qpoly.evaluate` is the reference algorithm, about 15% slower
  in `pisot_polynomial_bench`), `poly_degree` (`qpoly.degree` copies),
  `poly_rem` (keeps length, returns the dividend for a zero divisor where
  `qpoly.remainder` aborts; `test_pisot_polynomials` pins it) and
  `sturm_chain` of `p` itself: `qpoly.sturm_chain` passes to the squarefree
  part first, and an all-`qpoly` `is_pisot_charpoly` ran about 17% slower on
  the 3,375 monic cubics with `|c_i| <= 7`. The two chains differ only for
  non-squarefree `p` with a root at a count endpoint, outside Sturm's
  hypothesis: the plain chain gives `-1` on `(-1, 1]` for `(x - 1)(x + 1)^2`.
  `is_pip` tests irreducibility first, and the `is_pisot_charpoly` verdicts
  agree on all 3,375 cubics. The chain is now built once per cubic rather
  than once per count: `test_census_library` 13.3/14.0 s to 8.5/8.2 s,
  `census.mojo` 91/98 s to 84/88 s. Claim receipts and the full Mojo test log
  are byte-identical before and after. · `kernel/psc/pisot.mojo`;

- 2026-10-06 · Tooling pitfall: `tools/verify_all.sh` and a `uv tool`
  `pytest` fail `manuscript source integrity` when `pypdf` is missing from
  that interpreter. That is the pinned dev dependency (`pyproject.toml`), not a
  manuscript defect; install `pypdf==6.19.0` into the interpreter that runs
  it. · `tests/test_check_manuscript_source.py`
- 2026-10-06 · Symmetry, endpoint maps, Barge class, bounded BPA, Dumont-Thomas,
  return lattices and the strong-coincidence automaton moved to the vendored
  `substitution_dynamics` over an explicit alphabet; only the Perron-field
  reserve and the C4 A..G names stay here. Pitfalls met: `psc.symmetry.word_key`
  renders arbitrary integer lists (cycle lengths, counts), so it stays the
  plain decimal concatenation rather than the package's bracketed letter key;
  pruning-independence makes the shortest coincidence witness, minimised
  sizes and coaccessible counts reproducible under any sound bound, which is
  how the package regressions pin this repository's outputs. Two orbits of a
  self-map of d letters that meet do so within d - 1 steps (exhaustive,
  d <= 6). · finite-math-kernels `tests/substitution_dynamics/`
- 2026-10-06 · Owner decision: the vendored `prolongable_points`
  (`substitution_dynamics/dumont_thomas.mojo`, finite-math-kernels
  `d61bcf8`) reports each letter at its minimal prolongable power only (its
  first return under the first-letter map), as its docstring says, not again
  at every multiple of its period up to `|A|`. Tribonacci now has one
  prolongable point `(1, 0)` instead of `(1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0)`;
  `test_oa_overlap_types` pins that. In `oa_type_inclusion_census` and
  `oa_failures_probe` only the `"points"` field of 17 of the 22 per-specimen
  JSON lines drops (3 -> 1, 5 -> 3, 6 -> 2), where the dropped powers were
  duplicates giving the same fixed-point word; union types, witnesses, every
  CI-pinned summary line and the claim receipts are byte-identical. The
  per-specimen lines are recorded nowhere in the repository. ·

- 2026-10-06 · Repository-wide PSC research audit confirms the canonical
  status is coherent after #153: PSC and `OP_seed`/#84 remain open, and no
  accidental PSC promotion was found. Highest-priority review debt is the
  October 4 PDS => PPVC/G1 => all-seed-termination chain, whose live surfaces
  still say human review pending. Research priority is narrowed to seed-strength
  #84 plus an occurrence-compatible adelic coverage/alignment theorem for #139;
  #9 should supply only portable ordered-factorization lemmas. PR #223's
  Dumont–Thomas streaming regression is resolved at the current FMK pin;
  PR #221 should not merge unchanged because its side-notes entry is missing
  and its base predates the current vendoring state. No claim status changes. ·
