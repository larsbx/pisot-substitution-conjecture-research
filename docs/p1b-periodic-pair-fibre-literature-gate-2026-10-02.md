# Literature gate: the fibre identification for strict-zipper periodic pairs — 2026-10-02

**Status:** stop/go literature gate for §5 of
`p1b-strict-zipper-periodic-pair-2026-10-02.md`. **Decision: proceed.**
Proposition F below, proved here, puts the two tilings of Theorem B in one
fibre of the maximal equicontinuous factor. It was first proved under a
hypothesis (R), the return module is all of `Z^3`. §5 now proves (R) for
every primitive substitution whose frequency vector has `Q`-independent
coordinates, in particular for every PIP substitution (Theorem R), so
Proposition F holds without hypothesis. Nothing here excludes a strict zipper
or proves PeriodicPairVertexCoincidence, AdelicPeriodicOffsetHitting, G1 or
the Pisot substitution conjecture.

## 1. Exact claim under review

For a primitive irreducible Pisot `sigma` on three letters, take interior
occurrences `sigma^r(i) = P i U` and `sigma^r(j) = Q j V` with
`w_0 = (M^r − I)^{−1}(pi(P) − pi(Q)) ∈ Z^3`. Let `T_A = T(i, P)` and
`T_B = T(j, Q) + <ell, w_0>`, the two `Phi^r`-fixed tilings with common centre
`c` (Theorem B). The claim is:

> (F) `g(T_A) = g(T_B)`, where `g: X_sigma → X_max` is the factor map onto
> the maximal equicontinuous factor of the translation action.

The note's §5 stated (F) as a reading resting on "the standard description of
`g` through Rauzy addresses". This gate replaces that reading with a proof
that uses only the eigenvalue criterion, and records the one hypothesis it
needs.

## 3. What the literature gives and what it does not

- **No off-the-shelf statement covers (F).** Barge–Gambaudo's global
  shadowing is the right notion. It is stated for unimodular substitutions
  only, and its lifts live in the cover with deck group `GR(Phi)`. The overlap
  offset `w_0` lives in `Z⟨ell⟩ = Z^3`. When `GR(Phi)` is a proper
  finite-index subgroup, bounded lift discrepancy in `Z^3` does not give
  global shadowing.
- **Strong regional proximality** (Barge 2013 Thm 4(6); Barge 2015 (3)) needs,
  for each radius, two tilings containing the two patches that agree on a
  large ball somewhere. For a reachable overlap the patches descend from a
  swap seed `(ab)^Z` against `(ba)^Z`, which need not be legal, so this
  criterion cannot be checked directly.
- **The eigenvalue route works without unimodularity** (§4). It needs the
  return module to be all of `Z^3`, which Theorem R (§5) supplies.

## 4. Proposition F (proved here)

*Hypothesis (R).* The **return module**
`Λ_ret = <pi(w) : w nonempty and legal, w w_1 legal>_Z` is all of `Z^3`.
Here `pi(w)` is the lifted displacement from an occurrence of the letter
`w_1` to the next occurrence of `w_1`. (The first version of this note wrote
`pi(u)` for a legal `a u a`. That is the displacement between the two
copies of `a` with the first copy left out; the displacement itself is
`pi(a u)`.) Equivalently, the uncollared return vectors span `Z⟨ell⟩`.
Theorem R (§5) proves (R) for every PIP substitution.

*Proposition F.* `g(T_A) = g(T_B)` for every PIP `sigma`.

*Proof.*

1. **The eigenvalue criterion on `Z^3`.** By (R), the return vectors `Ξ`
   generate `Z⟨ell⟩` (Theorem R). By Solomyak's criterion each eigenvalue `b` has
   `e^{2 pi i b beta^n x} → 1` for `x ∈ Ξ`, hence for the group they
   generate. So `||b beta^n <ell, z>|| → 0` for every `z ∈ Z^3`. Steps 3 and
   4 use this for all bounded prefix vectors, not only for `w_0`, which is
   why (R) is needed for the whole module.
2. **Exponential rate.** Fix `z` and put `theta = b <ell, z>`. By Pisot's
   theorem `theta ∈ Q(beta)`. Pick `D` with `D theta ∈ Z[beta]`. Then
   `Tr(D theta beta^n) ∈ Z`, so `||D theta beta^n|| <= C rho^n`, where
   `rho < 1` is the largest conjugate modulus. Hence
   `theta beta^n ≡ (m_n + eps_n)/D (mod 1)` with `m_n ∈ Z` and
   `|eps_n| <= C rho^n`. Since `||theta beta^n|| → 0`, eventually
   `m_n ≡ 0 (mod D)`, so `||theta beta^n|| <= C rho^n / D`.
3. **A continuous eigenfunction.**
   - For `T ∈ X_sigma`, let `y_n(T)` be the left endpoint of the level-`n`
     supertile containing `0`. The supertile is unique by recognizability:
     `sigma` is primitive and aperiodic, so `Phi` is a homeomorphism. If `0`
     lies on a supertile boundary, the two choices differ by
     `<ell, M^n e_a>`, which step 1 sends to zero, so the limit below is
     unchanged.
   - Consecutive differences are `y_n − y_{n+1} = <ell, M^n z_n>` with
     `z_n = pi(p_n)` the Parikh vector of a proper prefix, so `z_n` is
     bounded.
   - By step 2, `F_b(T) := lim_n e^{2 pi i b y_n(T)}` converges uniformly.
     It is continuous, and `F_b(T − t) = e^{−2 pi i b t} F_b(T)`, since
     `y_n(T − t) = y_n(T) − t` while `0` stays inside the same supertile.
   - So `F_b` is a continuous eigenfunction for `b`. By minimality it is the
     eigenfunction for `b`, up to a constant.
4. **Evaluating on the pair.** `T_A − c` and `T_B − c` are `Phi^r`-fixed
   about `0`. Their level-`rn` supertiles at `0` are the inflated tiles `i`
   and `j`, with left endpoints `−beta^{rn} c` and `beta^{rn}(<ell, w_0> − c)`.
   Hence
   `F_b(T_A − c) / F_b(T_B − c) = lim_n e^{−2 pi i b <ell, M^{rn} w_0>} = 1`
   by (R), since `w_0 ∈ Z^3`.
5. **Same fibre.** Every eigenfunction can be chosen continuous (BK Thm 5.1).
   For a minimal action, `X_max` is the dual of the group of continuous
   eigenvalues, and `g(T) = g(T')` iff every continuous eigenfunction agrees
   on `T` and `T'`. So `g(T_A − c) = g(T_B − c)`, and translating by `c`
   gives `g(T_A) = g(T_B)`.

`square`

Neither unimodularity nor reachability from a swap seed is used. Only the
integrality of `w_0` and (R) are, and (R) is Theorem R.

## 5. Theorem R (hypothesis (R) holds)

**Theorem R.** *Let `sigma` be primitive on a finite alphabet `A`, and suppose
the coordinates of its frequency vector `r` (the right Perron eigenvector,
`r > 0`) are linearly independent over `Q`. Then `Λ_ret = Z^A`. In particular
`Λ_ret = Z^3` for every PIP substitution on three letters.*

*Proof.*

1. **Coboundary form.** Let `chi: Z^A → Q/Z` be a homomorphism that vanishes
   on `Λ_ret`. Fix a two-sided sequence `x` in the subshift of `sigma`.
   Primitivity makes the subshift minimal, so every legal word occurs in `x`.
   Put `G(n) = chi(pi(x_[0,n)))` for `n >= 0` and `G(n) = −chi(pi(x_[n,0)))`
   for `n < 0`. If `n < m` and `x_n = x_m`, then `x_[n,m)` is a generator of
   `Λ_ret`, so `G(m) = G(n)`. Hence `G(n) = H(x_n)` for a function
   `H: A → Q/Z`. Then `chi(e_{x_n}) = G(n+1) − G(n) = H(x_{n+1}) − H(x_n)`.
   Since every legal two-letter word occurs in `x`, this gives
   `chi(e_a) = H(c) − H(a)` for every legal `ac`. Put
   `K(a) = H(a) + chi(e_a)`. Then every letter `c` that can follow `a` has
   `H(c) = K(a)`.
2. **Counting.** Fix `h ∈ Q/Z` and `N >= 1`. By step 1,
   `H(x_{n+1}) = K(x_n)`, so
   `#{0 <= n < N : H(x_n) = h} − #{0 <= n < N : K(x_n) = h}`
   `= [H(x_0) = h] − [H(x_N) = h]`, which lies in `{−1, 0, 1}`. Divide by `N`.
   Letter frequencies exist (primitivity implies unique ergodicity), so
   `sum_{H(a) = h} r_a = sum_{K(a) = h} r_a`, that is,
   `<1_{H = h} − 1_{K = h}, r> = 0`.
3. **Independence.** The vector `1_{H = h} − 1_{K = h}` is an integer vector
   orthogonal to `r`, so by hypothesis it is zero: `H(a) = h` iff `K(a) = h`.
   This holds for every `h`, so `H = K`, so `chi(e_a) = 0` for every `a`,
   and `chi = 0`.
4. **Conclusion.** If `L` is a proper subgroup of `Z^A`, then `Z^A / L` is a
   nonzero finitely generated abelian group, so it has a quotient `Z` or
   `Z/n` with `n >= 2`. Either maps nontrivially to `Q/Z` (`1 ↦ 1/2`,
   respectively `1 ↦ 1/n`). Composing gives a nonzero `chi` vanishing on
   `L`. By step 3 no such `chi` exists for
   `L = Λ_ret`, so `Λ_ret = Z^A`.
5. **PIP substitutions.** If the characteristic polynomial of `M` is
   irreducible, take `r ∈ Q(beta)^A`. If `<v, r> = 0` for some `v ∈ Q^A`,
   then applying the field embeddings gives `<v, r^tau> = 0` for the
   eigenvectors `r^tau` of all conjugates of `beta`. These form a basis of
   `C^A`, so `v = 0`. This is the same fact as the `Q`-independence of `ell`
   used throughout the repository.

`square`

**Remarks.**

- *The two-letter graph.* Step 1 holds in both directions: `chi` vanishes on
  `Λ_ret` iff `chi` is a coboundary on the edges of the two-letter graph `G`
  (edge `a -> c` when `ac` is legal). For the converse, a return word
  `w w_1` telescopes to `H(w_1) − H(w_1) = 0`. A coboundary is the same as a
  character vanishing on the cycle lattice of `G`, because `G` is strongly
  connected (primitivity) and a closed walk is a sum of simple cycles. So `Λ_ret` and the cycle
  lattice of `G` have the same annihilator in `(Q/Z)^A`, and they are equal.
  This is `Lambda_1` of `mojo/psc/return_lattice.mojo`, computed there by
  the same identification (`return-lattice-literature-gate-2026-10-02.md`,
  which credits it to Barge–Gambaudo Lemma 15). That gate certifies
  `Lambda_1 = Z^3` on the 4,554 corpus specimens; Theorem R proves it for
  every PIP substitution. Its finding that `Lambda_n` for `n > 1` has index
  `> 1` when `abs(det M) = 2` does not touch Proposition F, whose step 1 uses
  only tile returns, `Lambda_1`.
- *A second proof on three letters.* `M Λ_ret ⊆ Λ_ret`, because `sigma`
  maps a return word of `a` to a return word of the first letter of
  `sigma(a)`. So `Λ_ret ⊗ Q` is a nonzero `M`-invariant rational subspace,
  and irreducibility makes its rank 3. The regression
  `test_every_digraph_on_three_letters_has_index_zero_or_one` checks all 512
  digraphs on three vertices: the cycle lattice has rank below 3 (303 of
  them) or is all of `Z^3` (209). There is no index `>= 2`, so rank 3 already
  means index 1.
- *Where the hypothesis is used.* Height-type cocycles are real. Dekking's
  `0 -> 010, 1 -> 201, 2 -> 102` has height 2: letter `0` occupies every
  other position, and `r_0 = r_1 + r_2` is a rational relation. Its
  incidence matrix is singular, so its return module has rank 2
  (`test_dekkings_height_two_substitution_has_rank_two`). Step 3 is exactly
  where an irreducible characteristic polynomial excludes this.
- *Finite-domain regression.* `mojo/tests/test_return_module.mojo` checks
  that the index is 1 on all 4,554 corpus specimens and on all 24,486
  specimens with total image length at most 8. A scratch sweep (not
  committed) found index 1 on all 135,990 PIP substitutions with images of
  length at most 4. It found no index `>= 2` among the 1,042,188 primitive
  substitutions with nonsingular incidence and images of length at most 4.
  These checks calibrate the implementation. The theorem does not rest on
  them.

## 6. Consequences and decision

By Theorem R, Proposition F holds for every PIP `sigma`. With Theorem B this
gives:

1. A reachable strict zipper gives a `Phi^r`-periodic pair in one fibre with
   **no common vertex**, hence no common tile.
2. BK Lemma 5.12 (equivalently Barge 2015, item (3)) then gives `cr >= 2`,
   hence no pure discrete spectrum (Barge 2013 Thm 4(5)).

This is consistent with the known chain from pure discrete spectrum through
productivity to the absence of strict zippers. With (R) removed it is an
unconditional implication (strict zipper ⇒ `cr >= 2`), but it does not
exclude anything new. The table in §5 of the note holds for every PIP
substitution:

| Periodic pair in one fibre | Equivalent to |
| --- | --- |
| no common tile | `cr >= 2` (known) |
| no common vertex | a strict zipper (Theorem B with Proposition F) |

**Decision: proceed.**

1. Record Proposition F in the note as proved, with Theorem R and the
   sources above.
2. Promote no ledger node. PeriodicPairVertexCoincidence stays open.
3. **Stop list.** None of the following may be offered as closing #139:
   - `cr = 1`-type statements, since they are pure discrete spectrum itself;
   - density or counting, since a hypothetical `cr = 2` substitution with
     measure-disjoint subtiles has vertex-disjoint generic pairs;
   - Barge–Gambaudo global shadowing without a proof that `GR(Phi) = Z⟨ell⟩`;
   - the Barge–Diamond configuration argument in vertex form, for the
     reason recorded in `p1b-barge-diamond-configuration-gate-2026-10-02.md`.
4. The candidate route of the first version of this note, the Barge–Diamond
   2002 configuration argument as run in Barge 2015 Lemma 2, has been read in
   full. Its gate is `p1b-barge-diamond-configuration-gate-2026-10-02.md`.
   Decision there: stop as a closing argument.
