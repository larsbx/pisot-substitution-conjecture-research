# Lost depth-indexed formulation: provenance record — 2026-10-01

**Status:** missing-source provenance record, plus finite-domain evidence
computed in this repository (§4–§6, each labelled with its evidence class).
Every item attributed to the lost files is unverified, is not cited by
any status surface, and must not enter `claim_governance.toml`, the ledgers or
the manuscript until it is reconstructed from scratch with its own proof or
replayable finite certificate. This note does not change the status of any
rung of `docs/proof-ladder.md`.

## 1. What was lost

Notes from earlier working conversations describe a parallel formulation of
the proof programme whose source files no longer exist anywhere reachable:

| Lost file | Recorded role |
| --- | --- |
| `PROOF_LADDER.md` (118 lines) | depth-indexed ladder, distinct from `docs/proof-ladder.md` |
| `PAPER_SUBMISSION.md` | submission plan |
| `LEVEL3_SUBMISSION.tex` | Level-3 manuscript draft |
| `SWEEP_RESULTS.md` | results of a 24,486-specimen sweep |
| `TRANSPORTABLE_METHOD.md` | method write-up |

Searched on 2026-10-01, with no hit for any file name or for the strings
`S-child`, `joint full support`, `9.26j`, `24486` / `24,486`,
`TRANSPORTABLE_METHOD`, `psc_suite`:

- every commit, every branch and every unreachable object (`git fsck
  --lost-found`) of this repository and of `larsbx/finite-math-kernels`;
- `larsbx/tiling-theory-research`, a single-commit stub;
- GitHub code search across the `larsbx` account;
- Google Drive full-text and title search.

## 2. The two formulations differ in what "level" indexes

In this repository a level names a **proof route**: Level 2 is finite BPA
(G1, reduced to the open G1b-2), and Level 3 is the SCC Producer, posed under
G1. The lost formulation used levels as **depth-indexed criteria** over a
larger class of substitutions. Statements do not transfer between the two
automatically. In particular, Level 3 here presupposes Level 2, so no
"higher level implies lower level" transfer exists on this ladder.

## 3. Recorded items and their disposition

| Recorded item (as the notes state it) | Disposition |
| --- | --- |
| Level 3 "computationally closed for all 24,486 substitutions with \|σ\| ≤ 8 via a 2-step criterion" | **Unverified; wording rejected.** The 2-step criterion's definition is lost. Under hypothesis-firewall item 8 of `docs/proof-ladder.md`, a finite sweep is finite-domain evidence and cannot close a level. The domain is recovered (§4). |
| "Joint full-support lemma", false by Tribonacci; remaining gap stated as joint-support growth | **Counterexample reproduced** (§5). The lemma plays no role on this repository's routes: the bad-SCC normal form already has `rank_Q(V_S) = \|A\|`. |
| "S-child" statement: child support = supp σ(x) ∪ supp σ(y) | **Elementary, to be re-derived where used:** σ(xy) = σ(x)σ(y), so supp σ(xy) = supp σ(x) ∪ supp σ(y). Which graph's "child" was meant is lost. |
| Level 2 "closed for ℤ-independent substitutions with max \|σ\| ≤ 4" (Thm 9.28, chain 9.26a–j) | **Unverified and suspect.** It adds ℤ-independence as a hypothesis, which firewall item 2 forbids, and it conflicts with G1b-2 remaining open. It may descend from the retracted inference "UD ⇒ bounded padding ⇒ finite BPA" (see `docs/completion-ledger-2026-09-11.md`); this is a conjecture about provenance, not a finding. If it is ever reconstructed, it can only be a restricted-class result inside G1b-2. On the total-length ≤ 8 part of that slice, finite `B_sigma` holds for every specimen as a finite-domain consequence of `docs/bpa-termination-by-overlap-depth-2026-10-02.md` (Proposition 1 with the exact overlap verdicts of §6), including the 120 whose direct builds exhaust the budget of §7. The recorded theorem and its proof remain lost, and nothing is claimed beyond that class. |
| 4,554-PIP `psc_suite` run | Matches this repository's standing corpus (`mojo/psc/corpus.mojo`). |

## 4. Recovered sweep domain

The count 24,486 is exactly the number of primitive irreducible Pisot
substitutions on three letters with **total** image length
Σ_a |σ(a)| ≤ 8. "|σ| ≤ 8" in the notes therefore meant total length, not
maximum image length. Cumulative counts by maximum image length:

| max_a \|σ(a)\| ≤ | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| count (Σ_a \|σ(a)\| ≤ 8) | 72 | 4,554 | 14,670 | 22,080 | 24,486 |

The standing 4,554 corpus is exactly the max-image ≤ 3 slice: total length 9
adds no member, because images of lengths (3,3,3) are constant-length, so
β = 3 and the incidence polynomial is reducible.

**Evidence class:** exact finite count, replayable in Mojo. The canonical
enumeration is `psc.corpus.pip_corpus_total_length`, and the regression
`test_the_total_length_corpus_contains_the_standing_corpus` in
`mojo/tests/test_census_library.mojo` pins the total, every cumulative slice,
and the max-image ≤ 3 slice's identity with the standing corpus, label for
label. The Python screen `src/psc_research/pip_screen.py` is the
independently written oracle and gives the same counts. The class is a corpus
for exploratory sweeps, not for censuses (§6).

## 5. Primitivity and joint-support exponents on the standing corpus

Also oracle-only, computed in the same session over the 4,554 corpus:

| k | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| specimens with primitivity exponent γ(M) = k | 0 | 2,880 | 1,596 | 66 | 12 |
| specimens whose pairwise joint support first fills at k | 1,152 | 2,958 | 444 | 0 | 0 |

Wielandt's bound `γ ≤ (d−1)² + 1 = 5` is attained by 12 specimens, and
`max_a |σ^γ(a)| ≤ 42` across the corpus. Tribonacci (σ: 1→12, 2→13, 3→1) has
supp σ(2) ∪ supp σ(3) = {1,3}, γ = 3, and first joint saturation at k = 3.

Passing to σ^k preserves Ω_σ, pure discrete spectrum and "∃n" coincidence
conditions, but it does not remove the obstruction on this repository's
routes: a bad closed SCC for σ, sampled every k steps, is still a bad closed
recurrent structure for σ^k.

## 6. Exploratory overlap sweep over the recovered domain

**Evidence class:** finite-domain evidence on the stated class only. It does
not reconstruct the lost 2-step criterion, does not close any level, and says
nothing about substitutions outside the class.

`mojo/swap_overlap_total_length_sweep.mojo` runs the survey of
`mojo/swap_overlap_census.mojo` unchanged over the 24,486 specimens of §4
(`psc.corpus.pip_corpus_total_length(8)`). It is an exhaustive, deterministic
exploratory sweep, not a census: the repository's censuses survey the
canonical 4,554 corpus (`AGENTS.md`, "The census library"). Because 24
specimens exhaust a diagnostic budget (below), the sweep reports itself
incomplete and exits non-zero after printing its summary. Two kernel changes made this
possible: the exact Perron layer is certified to column sum
`MAX_CERTIFIED_COLUMN_SUM = 6` with the overflow bound stated in
`mojo/psc/perron_field3.mojo`, and `PerronCache` no longer leaves a stale
entry behind a refused build. The same driver on the standing corpus
reproduces every published line exactly.

| | standing 4,554 | total length ≤ 8: 24,486 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| overlap graphs built / capped | 4,554 / 0 | 24,486 / 0 |
| total overlap states | 1,118,850 | 7,522,892 |
| largest overlap graph | 2,640 | 14,826 |
| specimens with a nonproductive overlap | 0 | 0 |
| maximum first-coincidence depth | 18 | 26 |
| maximum first left-aligned depth | 17 | 24 |
| maximum prefix / suffix strong-coincidence depth | 15 / 15 | 15 / 15 |
| unimodular collapsing seed patches (must be 0) | 0 | 0 |

Diagnostics that did not complete, reported as such:

- **24 specimens** exceed the 200,000-state cap of the collared occurrence
  graph, so their collar and pump-lift diagnostics are inconclusive. Their
  productivity verdict is decided before those diagnostics (commit
  `bb79c1c`; the first run decided it last and so skipped it), and all 24 are
  productive. The figures above combine the first full run with a run of the
  same survey over those 24 specimens; the survey is deterministic.
- **12 specimens**, one orbit under relabelling and reversal (representative
  `0 -> 1, 1 -> 2, 2 -> 022102`), keep a collar collision at the survey cap of
  radius 6 without a collapsing seed patch by level 6.

The exploratory sweep `mojo/separation_radius_sweep.mojo` (not a census;
exhaustive and deterministic) computes the separation radius with cap 12,
crossed with collapse by level 12, under a collared-state budget of
1,000,000. It completes on all 24,486 specimens with none capped or failed,
so the 24 above resolve within the larger budget:

| separation radius | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 9 | survivors at 12 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| total-length class | 2,264 | 13,688 | 6,092 | 1,230 | 288 | 60 | 12 | 852 |
| standing slice | 618 | 2,664 | 912 | 216 | 12 | 12 | 0 | 120 |

The standing slice reproduces the published table of
`docs/p1-overlap-collar-2026-09-16.md` §3.3. All 852 survivors at radius 12
have a collapsing patch by level 12, no survivor lacks one, and no collapsing
specimen resolves. The 12 specimens of the orbit above are exactly the
specimens of radius 9 (the regression
`test_a_non_collapsing_collision_can_need_radius_nine` pins the
representative). So the coincidence of survivors with collapsing patches,
which the radius-6 survey cap broke on this class, holds again at cap 12:
those 12 exceed the survey cap, not because of periodicity. This is finite
evidence at these caps only.

## 7. Exploratory bounded BPA sweep on the longest-image ≤ 4 slice

**Evidence class:** finite-domain evidence on the stated slice and budgets
only. A build that exhausts a budget is inconclusive; it is neither a
counterexample to G1 nor evidence of termination. Nothing here bears on
G1b-2 in general.

`mojo/bpa_total_length_sweep.mojo` builds `B_sigma` with
`psc.bounded_bpa.build_bounded` for the 14,670 specimens of §4 with longest
image at most 4, under the shared 20,000-state cap and a state-length budget
of 100,000 letters. A state-count cap alone did not bound memory here: on the
first attempt one specimen grew a single automaton past 9 GB while staying
under 20,000 states.

| longest image | specimens | terminated | exhausted (state length) | non-productive | largest `B_sigma` | longest state |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | 72 | 72 | 0 | 0 | 32 | 16 |
| 3 | 4,482 | 4,482 | 0 | 0 | 1,502 | 48,020 |
| 4 | 10,116 | 9,996 | 120 | 0 | 4,305 | 62,707 |

The longest-image ≤ 3 rows are the standing corpus, and their longest state,
48,020, matches the figure recorded in `docs/proof-ladder.md`. No build
exhausted the state count. The sweep exits non-zero because 120 builds are
inconclusive.

The 120 inconclusive specimens form one structural family: image lengths
(1, 3, 4) with one letter sent to the cube of another (for example
`0 -> 1, 1 -> 222, 2 -> 0222`), determinant 3, and one of two characteristic
polynomials, `x^3 - 2x^2 - 3x - 3` (72 specimens) or `x^3 - 3x^2 - 3`
(48 specimens). An exploratory probe of `0 -> 1, 1 -> 222, 2 -> 0222` (not a
sweep) under larger length budgets finds at most 102 states, while the
longest state grows from 85,719 letters to 280,899 and then exceeds 400,000.
The ratio 280,899 / 85,719 ≈ 3.2770 is close to the Perron root
β ≈ 3.2790 of `x^3 - 3x^2 - 3`, as if one irreducible balanced pair kept
inflating with almost no coincidence cut. The chain terminates:
`docs/bpa-termination-by-overlap-depth-2026-10-02.md` proves that a
productive seed-patch overlap graph of largest first-coincidence depth `D`
bounds every balanced-pair state by `2 beta^D ell_max`, and this specimen's
graph is productive with `D = 19`, giving a bound of about `4.5e10`
letters. The budget exhaustion is growth towards that bound, not an infinite
automaton, and the same argument gives a finite `B_sigma` for all 120
inconclusive specimens and for the whole class of §6.

## 8. Follow-up tasks

1. Mathematical review of Proposition 1 of
   `docs/bpa-termination-by-overlap-depth-2026-10-02.md` (manuscript
   Proposition 5.46), now recorded in the ledger as `G1OverlapRoute`.
2. Decide whether finiteness already follows from every reachable overlap
   reaching a half-coincidence, as Sirvent–Solomyak Theorem 5.6 suggests
   (`docs/bpa-overlap-depth-literature-gate-2026-10-02.md` §6).
