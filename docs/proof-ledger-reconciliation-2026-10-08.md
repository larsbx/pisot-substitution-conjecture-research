# Proof-ledger reconciliation — 2026-10-08

**Scope:** reconcile PRs [#236](https://github.com/larsbx/pisot-substitution-conjecture-research/pull/236),
[#237](https://github.com/larsbx/pisot-substitution-conjecture-research/pull/237), and
[#241](https://github.com/larsbx/pisot-substitution-conjecture-research/pull/241).
The canonical registration baseline is
`main@33a1b8b6cffc10c7f1e5be41a22325897a5072e4`:
#241 was already merged before this reconciliation. Its nine canonical names,
four G1 alternatives and formal-productivity assumption model are retained.
The remaining contributions are integrated in #237; #236 is superseded only
after the integration is validated and merged.

During final review main advanced to
`d98e027f8f22400fd827fbce8635d3f6a8ea2e6d` through PR #244. Its class-B
cross-check documentation and archived outputs are retained byte-for-byte;
both append-only side-notes additions are preserved. The cross-check's shared
primitive boundary and distinction from proof remain explicit. This update
changes no theorem node or formal source; the source inventory is regenerated.


Main then advanced to `8d91e48a6149bdab91e2a7d0cdc82873a829a50b` through
PR #245. Its Rouché-first unit-disc certificate and Jury fallback, documentation,
and symbolic-cone regression are retained. The changed Mojo test is rerun;
its actual receipt replaces the earlier receipt for that test alone. This
current-main contribution changes no proof-ledger node or Lean source.

Inspected source heads: #236 `608f4b4978a8297c345587c622bd5e7afdaae762`,
#237 `9e99184156e52e80a32c7457222572367af80a93`, and #241
`ebc815f1b1bf2ba32b11a94462f9b575762954d7`. This reconciliation changes no
open mathematical premise to proved and changes no finite-domain claim scope.

During validation #236 was independently rebased to
`3eb62008d39aa3a531b27980615972e0d5b80a44`. That current head was also compared:
its census implementation and scope corrections are retained; its additional
vertex-certificate test declarations and explicit reconciled-baseline evidence
are incorporated. Its regrouping bundles the Meyer result with overlap
coincidence, whereas this integration keeps the two already-reviewed imports
separate. #237's corrected partial spectral locators and #241's direct
leftmost-child fixed-end argument remain authoritative. The independent
derivations in #236's review are unchanged by that rebase and remain here,
with the live grouping explained below.

## One representation of each result

| Source definitions | Canonical representation | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| #236 `PotentialOverlapFiniteDescent` and `OverlapCycleBoxBound`; #237 `PotentialOverlapFiniteDescent`; #241 `BoxCycleContainment` | `BoxCycleContainment` | Both parts of Ω1 remain grouped in the merged node; the finite descendant graph is per starting overlap, not the entire potential-overlap set. |
| #236 `BoxFormalProductivityEquivalence`; #237 `BoxProductivityEquivalence`; #241 `BoxAutomatonCertificate` | `BoxAutomatonCertificate` | Theorem Ω is the per-specimen equivalence between formal productivity and a complete productive box. |
| #236 `PisotMeyerProperty`; #237 `PisotFamilyMeyerProperty`; Meyer hypothesis folded into #241's import | `PisotMeyerProperty` | A separate literature import makes the scalar Pisot, repetitivity and FLC hypothesis transfer visible. |
| All three overlap-coincidence imports | `OverlapCoincidenceCriterion` | One imported sufficiency criterion for occurring overlaps with Meyer return vectors; no new converse is registered. |
| #236 `BoxAutomatonPDSCertificate`; #237 `BoxPDSCertificate` | `BoxAutomatonPDSCertificate` | A per-specimen implication with its executable premise inside the statement. This is distinct from assuming productivity uniformly. |
| #241 `FormalProductivity` and consequences (a)–(c) | `FormalProductivity`, `PDSFormalProductivityRoute`, `PDSFormalProductivitySeedRoute`, `G1FormalProductivityRoute` | The universal premise stays open. Consequence (a) derives from the per-specimen certificate; the other two routes retain their existing mechanism and dependencies. |
| #236 sign/periodic-pair nodes; #237 sign/periodic-pair nodes; #241 `LeftmostChainCycleStructure` | `LeftmostChainCycleStructure` | Lemma S, LC and LC4 remain grouped. The zero index is on the later-starting side; the prefix object is a right-infinite ray. |
| #236 and #241 `LeftmostChainG1Certificate` | `LeftmostChainG1Certificate` | LC5 remains a per-specimen implication, never a sufficient branch establishing uniform G1. |

No competing names in this table are registered as additional theorem nodes.
`tools/make_ledger.py` owns the definitions and generated relationships.
Content-addressed record IDs change when evidence or dependency content changes;
all edges and G1 alternatives are regenerated against the resulting IDs.
Canonical names are retained rather than copying incompatible old digests.

The direct certificate's dependency closure is exactly:
`BoxAutomatonPDSCertificate`, `BoxAutomatonCertificate`, `BoxCycleContainment`,
`PisotMeyerProperty`, and `OverlapCoincidenceCriterion`. It contains no
Theorem B, Lemma C, Proposition F, Theorem R, Theorem S or Proposition V(2).
Neither import alone establishes it. The uniform overlap-coincidence route
additionally needs the open `FormalProductivity` gate.

`MCLedgerFormalProductivityGateAssumed` retains the FP scenario and now assumes
the explicit Meyer import as well as overlap coincidence and the density bridge.
It reaches G1 and both PDS route nodes while leaving canonical PDS, SCC Producer
and the seed gates unestablished. Open/import-only scenarios leave uniform G1,
PDS and formal productivity unestablished. These models check dependency
establishment; they do not prove a mathematical theorem or a specimen verdict.

## Review and computational evidence retained

The independent [#236 review](review-box-leftmost-ledger-2026-10-08.md) and
[#237 audit](proof-bank-audit-2026-10-08.md) remain available alongside #241's
append-only side-notes review. The Ω1, Ω, direct certificate, literature and LC
records bind the review sources, date, inspected baseline, reconciliation
locator and pending human review. The previously reviewed source counts and
proposed names are mapped here; they are not competing live ledgers.

The scope corrections retain the nonsingular field-embedding justification,
actual-overlap hypothesis transfer, invertibility of `I-M^r`, later-starting
index convention, half-line comparison, periodic starting-letter count, and
opposite-sign argument for mirror cycles. The leftmost fixed-centre proof
retains #241's removal of the unnecessary Lemma C dependency.

The standing LC census has 10,584 sign/shape checks, 10,128 integral replays
and 456 uncomputed offsets. These warrants stay separate. The #236 completion
gate raises on a capped graph, inconsistent sign/shape totals or failed
integral replay. Uncomputed long offsets remain labelled uncomputed. This is
a repair of exit-status semantics, not a new full census or universal claim.

## Lean infrastructure and the two P2 repairs

#237's shared provisioning/build scripts, pinned direct Lake requirement,
compiled-declaration audit, session hook, CI integration and generated proof
bank are retained. Its spectral evidence correction cites the archived
certificate; the centralizer and trace lemmas remain partial Lean support.
The box/LC theorems and literature imports have no complete Lean binding.

1. `lean_declarations` now scans `PscVerif.lean` alongside nested library
   modules. The adjacent replay script is not a library module. A regression
   inserts a root theorem and lemma and requires both in the inventory and
   compiled-audit receipt.
2. Lake checkout verification compares HEAD and rejects tracked index or
   working-tree changes, including deletions, untracked files and ignored inputs; an unreadable Git status also
   refuses verification. Real temporary Git checkouts test both pin-check
   modes with staged, unstaged, deleted and untracked sources at an unchanged
   pinned HEAD. Ignored Lean sources and configuration inputs are refused,
   including files hidden by local Git exclusions. Only the declared Lean/Lake
   and ProofWidgets frontend build-artifact paths may contain ignored cache
   files; Lean/Lake source inputs remain forbidden there.

The original seven P2 regression cases failed against the #237 checker.
Current-head review then found the untracked-source gap in the first repair;
two additional negative cases reproduce it before the final refusal check.
A further review reproduced an ignored-source injection. Four more controls
cover ignored Lean sources and cache-adjacent configuration inputs in both
pin-check modes. Four byte-comparison controls also reproduce edits hidden by assume-unchanged
and skip-worktree flags. Tracked file bytes, types and executable permissions
are now compared directly with the pinned Git tree. Git replacement objects
are disabled for every dependency inspection; two further controls replace a
pinned commit while retaining its HEAD SHA and apparently clean status, and
reproduce acceptance before the fix. All nineteen negative
cases pass with these repairs. Existing audit controls still reject missing
receipts, incomplete cached output, nonstandard axioms and failed builds.
The subsequent modifier review found that valid `nonrec`/`public` headers
could still evade the source scan. The inventory now covers every modifier
in the pinned Lean declaration grammar, balanced multiline attributes and
multiline headers. Six more negative controls require those named proofs in
both the source inventory and audit receipt; all twenty-five inventory/pin
controls pass. Compilation still decides declaration validity and proof status.
Two further negative controls show that compact scoped commands (`open ... in`
or `set_option ... in`) must refuse an unsupported inventory instead of silently
omitting their proofs. Every unaccounted theorem/lemma header now refuses the
scan. All twenty-seven inventory/dependency negative controls pass.
Private proofs retain their source-facing names and module identities in the
bank. Audit replay uses Lean's native `privateToUserName`, emitting both the
unique compiled name and normalized source name. Coverage matches module/name
pairs; declaration/theorem totals still count unique compiled declarations.
Two compatibility controls cover private theorem/lemma names and the same
private helper names in different modules, including refusal when one module's
proof is missing. Claim bindings with ambiguous source names refuse verification.
A final cache review showed that clean source checkouts alone cannot justify
reusing ignored compiled dependencies with matching hash/trace metadata.
`check_lean.sh` now copies only project source/configuration into a new temporary
workspace. It clones and verifies pinned dependencies, disables inherited
Lean paths and Lake cache/configuration overrides, and bootstraps the pinned
Mathlib cache tool from those clean sources. Downloads come from the fixed
upstream source-hash namespace into a new empty cache. Neither caller dependency
artifacts nor local Lake configuration enter the build. The pinned compiler
and that upstream HTTPS cache remain explicit trust inputs; source checking
alone is not described as attesting downloaded binaries. PSC is compiled and
audited in this workspace, which is deleted afterward. The negative dispatcher
regression plants compiled artifacts with coherent metadata in both project
and dependency caches, sets caller cache/path overrides, and fails against the
previous dispatcher. The repaired dispatcher excludes them while retaining
actual temporary-Git pin/byte checks and audit-receipt validation in the test.

The subsequent compiler-selection review reproduced inherited Elan environment
and directory overrides. Every Lake invocation now uses `elan run` with the
explicit checked-in toolchain; both Lean and Lake executable version receipts
must match that release before cloning, building or auditing. Four negative
controls cover environment/directory overrides and mismatched Lean/Lake
versions. These controls model Elan/compiler dispatch without requiring a
second installed compiler; the native isolated run separately exercises the
pinned release with an invalid inherited `ELAN_TOOLCHAIN` override.

The proof bank is an inventory of governed claims, named source proofs and
apparent statement openings. Actual Lean evidence requires the fresh compiled
audit; source inventory completeness conveys no mathematical proof authority.

## Validation

Current validation and any unavailable toolchain are recorded in #237's
updated evidence table before merge. Generated ledger, TLA+, governance,
relationship and proof-bank artifacts are regenerated from their sources.
Pinned Lean provisioning and the complete library build succeeded locally;
fresh audit replay inspected 146 local declarations, including 92 theorems,
reached all 27 named source proofs, and accepted only `propext`,
`Classical.choice` and `Quot.sound`. A scratch-only executable-path shim
mapped Lean's own numeric `/proc/<pid>/exe` lookup to `/proc/self/exe`; no
compiler, verifier or dependency source changed. GitHub runs remained queued.
The real pixi activation test was attempted but package downloads failed at
the container's DNS/proxy boundary; direct pinned-Mojo tests and the 4,554
specimen census passed. This network limitation is not credited as a pass.
The run does not claim human peer review, a proof of PSC, a uniform G1/PDS
verdict, or completed tensor/spectral formalization.
