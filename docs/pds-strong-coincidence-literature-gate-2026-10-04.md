# Literature gate: does pure discrete spectrum give all-pairs strong coincidence? — 2026-10-04

**Status:** targeted literature stop/go note (`AGENTS.md`, review gate). It
imports one published statement with an explicit hypothesis caveat and
changes no ledger node or claim status.

## 1. The question

Corollary FP′ of `formal-productivity-reduction-2026-10-04.md` reads

```text
FP  <=>  PDS and SC_all,
```

with SC_all the productivity of the six aligned pairs `(i, j, 0)`, `i != j`,
i.e. left (prefix) strong coincidence for every pair of letters. If pure
discrete spectrum already implies SC_all, the realization-free statement FP
costs nothing beyond PDS.

## 2. Prior art read

**Akiyama–Lee**, *Overlap coincidence to strong coincidence in substitution
tiling dynamics*, European J. Combin. 39 (2014) 233–243
([arXiv:1403.0377](https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0377)); primary text read:
Definitions 3.1–3.3, Corollary 4.2, Lemma 4.4, Corollary 4.5, Examples
4.6–4.7, Remark 4.8.

- Overlap coincidence is equivalent to pure discrete spectrum for self-affine
  tilings with the Meyer property (their introduction; this equivalence is
  the one the repository already uses through Akiyama–Lee 2011).
- **Corollary 4.5.** For an irreducible Pisot substitution on
  `{1, ..., m}` whose natural suspension tiling has overlap coincidence there
  are `L, M` such that the length-`M` prefixes of `sigma^L(1), ...,
  sigma^L(m)` have the same Parikh vector and end with the same letter.
- Definition 3.1 (prefix strong coincidence) asks, for every pair of
  prototiles, a common tile of the level-`L` supertiles with the left ends
  aligned. Corollary 4.5 is the simultaneous form for all letters at once.

Corollary 4.5 implies SC_all: the length-`(M − 1)` prefixes of every
`sigma^L(i)` have equal abelianisations and are followed by the same letter,
so every aligned pair `(i, j, 0)` has a coincidence descendant at depth `L`.

## 3. Hypotheses that transfer, and the caveat

| Hypothesis | Standing PIP regime |
| --- | --- |
| irreducible Pisot, primitive | transfers (PIP) |
| natural suspension tiling, left end points as control points | the repository's tile lengths are the left Perron vector; transfers |
| overlap coincidence ⟺ PDS | Meyer property holds for Pisot inflation; transfers |
| trivial height group (their Lemma 4.4) | cited to Barge–Kwapisz 2006, Thm. 12.1 (a **unimodular** paper) and to Sing, PhD thesis 2006, Lemma 6.34. For `|det M| > 1` the statement rests on Sing's thesis, which this gate has **not** read. |

No unimodularity hypothesis appears in Corollary 4.5 itself; the
non-unimodular case is exactly as strong as the cited height-group lemma.

## 4. Negative controls

- Examples 4.6–4.7 (reducible `Z/2`-extensions of Fibonacci and Rauzy) fail
  prefix and suffix strong coincidence; 4.7 even has overlap coincidence.
  Irreducibility is therefore essential, and reducible recodings must not be
  used to transfer the statement.
- Remark 4.8 records Nakaishi's claimed converse (strong coincidence ⇒ PDS,
  unimodular). The repository treats that claim as adjacent and unimported;
  this gate does not change that.

## 5. Decision: proceed, with the caveat recorded

Import Corollary 4.5 for irreducible Pisot substitutions, conditional in the
non-unit case on the cited height-group lemma (Sing 2006). Consequences, with
the dependencies of Corollary FP′ (Proposition V, Theorem S, Theorem 5.38 with
Barge–Štimac–Williams):

- **FP ⟺ PDS** for PIP `sigma`: formal productivity of every potential
  overlap is equivalent to pure discrete spectrum. The realization-free
  route asks for no more than PSC itself.
- **SC_all is necessary for PSC**: a PIP substitution failing all-pairs
  prefix strong coincidence would have no pure discrete spectrum. The aligned
  route (#138) is therefore not optional on any route to PSC.
- Under PDS, Lemma VT's hypothesis holds automatically.
