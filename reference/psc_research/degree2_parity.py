"""Mod-2 characteristic-polynomial sieve for degree-2 strict SCCs.

For a strict closed nonproductive SCC whose first nonzero scattered-subword
defect is K2, the existing intertwiners give

    chi_M       | chi_N,
    chi_Lambda2 | chi_S,

with integer matrices N=A+B and S=A-B.  Since N == S (mod 2), their
characteristic polynomials are equal over F_2.  Hence that common polynomial
must be divisible by both reduced cubics, giving a lower bound on the SCC size
from their least common multiple.
