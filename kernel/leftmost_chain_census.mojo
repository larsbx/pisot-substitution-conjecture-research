"""Exact census: is every terminal leftmost cycle a prefix-vs-interior pair?

Proposition LC of docs/p1b-leftmost-chain-periodic-pair-2026-10-05.md. The
leftmost child is a function on nonzero-offset vertices, so each such vertex's
chain either reaches offset zero -- the vertex is in `CU`, a catch-up hit --
or runs into a terminal cycle, and those cycles are exactly the witnesses that
`CU` is missed. For each standing-corpus specimen this census reads off every
terminal cycle of that function and checks the proposition's two assertions:

- the offset keeps one strict sign along the cycle, so the index used on the
  side whose tile starts first is `0` at every step;
- composed over the cycle, that side's index in `sigma^r` is `0` with a
  nonempty tail -- a prefix occurrence `sigma^r(i) = i U` -- and the other
  side's index is strictly interior -- an interior occurrence
  `sigma^r(j) = Q j V` with `Q`, `V` nonempty.

The offset `w0 = (I - M^r)^{-1} pi(Q)` is replayed over Z where `M^r` stays in
the exact integer range (`MAX_INTEGRAL_R`), and a longer cycle is reported in
its own column rather than assumed: an uncomputed offset is not a verdict. A
capped box graph is likewise reported, never counted as a pass.

A specimen with no terminal cycle is one where every nonzero-offset vertex
reaches a catch-up; the catch-up-free specimens are at the other extreme,
where every recurrent vertex runs into a cycle. Both counts are reported, so
the census also says how the leftmost-chain picture lines up with the Q1
trichotomy of `one_tile_census.mojo`.

Usage: `mojo run -I . leftmost_chain_census.mojo [total]`. With `total` it
surveys the 24,486 specimens of total image length at most 8.
