"""Exact recurrence diagnostics for the overlap-productivity zipper branch.

A strict left-boundary zipper obstruction from issue #84 would contain a
directed cycle avoiding coincidences and every offset-zero overlap.  This
module asks for precisely that finite signature by deleting those vertices and
taking SCCs of the induced graph.  It does not delete right-aligned overlaps:
the suffix boundary case is a distinct obstruction and must not be silently
conflated with zero-shift avoidance.

This is a diagnostic constraint, not a proof that every such cycle can occur
in a closed nonproductive component.
