"""`B_sigma` under a state-count *and* a state-length budget.

The canonical builder in `substitution_dynamics.automaton` caps the number of
reachable states, which is the right contract inside the standing PIP regime:
there bounded discrepancy keeps every reachable balanced pair short. An
exploratory sweep visits substitutions with no discrepancy bound, where the
states themselves grow like `beta^n` and a state-count cap alone does not
bound the memory a single state needs.

`build_bounded` therefore stops on either budget and reports which one, so an
exhausted resource is recorded as inconclusive. A bounded automaton is a
partial prefix of the graph: like a capped one it must never be read as a
counterexample or as a proof. This is a second builder with a different
contract, not a copy of the canonical one, which stays vendored and unpatched.
