"""Deterministic finite automata over an integer alphabet.

The operations a decision procedure needs, and no more: intersection, union,
complement, the subset construction that discharges an existential quantifier
over one track, the widening and cylinder that put a single-track condition
into a product in the first place, emptiness with a witness word, and Moore
minimisation.

Every automaton here is *total*: `delta` has one entry per (state, letter), so
complement is exactly a flip of the accepting set and no operation has to
special-case a missing transition. A partial transition table is made total by
`with_sink` before anything else touches it.

This module states no theorem about substitutions. It is the engine under
`psc.dumont_thomas`, where the letters of a fixed point become the outputs of a
run, and it is the engine a first-order decision procedure over a numeration
system would need. What that procedure additionally requires -- recognisability
of addition in the numeration -- is an imported theorem, gated in
`docs/automatic-sequence-route-literature-gate-2026-09-17.md`, and nothing here
supplies it.
