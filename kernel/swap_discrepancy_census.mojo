"""Exact swap-discrepancy census over the alphabet-3 PIP corpus.

For every primitive irreducible Pisot substitution on {0,1,2} with images of
length at most 3 (exact Sturm-sequence screening), builds `B_sigma` from the
three swap seeds under a cap of 20000 states and reports the maximum
discrepancy and the longest reachable state.  Finite evidence only: the
bounded-discrepancy theorem is proved in
docs/source-imports/issue-45/g1b1-bounded-discrepancy-reconstruction.md and no
computation verifies its constant `D_sigma`.
