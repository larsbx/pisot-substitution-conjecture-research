"""Addition automata over the corpus, each verified on a bounded domain.

For every sampled specimen: build the linear numeration the substitution
carries, compare its greedy digits with the Dumont-Thomas path digits, and --
where the digit alphabet is small enough to be worth the triple alphabet --
build the addition automaton and check it against the arithmetic it claims to
recognise. Every true sum below the bound must be accepted and every near miss
rejected; a single failure of either kind is printed and counted.

Three outcomes are kept apart, which is the point of the driver. A built and
verified automaton is finite evidence about that specimen. A construction that
exceeds the state cap is a refusal: the Pisot theorem says a finite state set
exists, this exploration did not find one inside the cap, and neither fact is a
verdict about the specimen. A specimen skipped for its alphabet size was never
attempted.

Nothing here decides a coincidence condition or moves a ledger entry
(`docs/automatic-sequence-route-literature-gate-2026-09-17.md`).
