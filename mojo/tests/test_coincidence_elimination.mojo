"""The coincidence formula decided by eliminating its quantifiers.

`psc.coincidence_formula` wires the conjunction into one automaton's accepting
condition. This is the other route: write the formula, give each conjunct to
the automaton that already recognises it, and let the kernel's product, union
and subset construction do the rest. The two must give one language, and that
is the substantive test here -- the direct automaton reads its letters off its
own state, the assembly reads them off the Dumont-Thomas letter map, and they
had never been made to agree.

The pieces are checked as well as the whole: the letter conjunct against
`path_letter` on enumerated pair words, and the projection against the
existential it is supposed to discharge, also by enumeration rather than by
trusting `project`.
