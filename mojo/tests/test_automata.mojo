"""Regressions for the automata kernel and the Dumont-Thomas numeration.

The kernel is the engine a decision procedure over a numeration system needs,
so what is pinned here is its algebra: complement is exact because transitions
are total, intersection and union are the synchronous product, projection is
the subset construction that discharges one existential quantifier, and
minimisation identifies exactly the automata with one language.

The numeration tests are the substantive ones. They say the automaton *is* the
fixed point -- letter by letter over a prefix, and by two counting identities
that tie it back to objects computed elsewhere in the repository: the image
lengths of the substitution, and the powers of its incidence matrix.
