"""Strong coincidence decided by formula, against the overlap graph, per pair.

For **every** specimen this decides `SC(i, j)` for each pair of letters by the
search of `psc.coincidence_formula`, which is cheap enough that sampling would
be a false economy, and then checks the answer twice over against two things
that share no step with it:

* **Each witness, re-derived.** A shortest accepted word splits into two
  Dumont-Thomas paths; `path_prefix_parikh` and `path_letter` recompute the
  Parikh vectors and the letters. This is a *consistency* check and is counted
  as one: those functions reuse `incidence_step`, the recurrence the automaton
  is built on, so a defect there could make the witness and its check agree.
  It catches a wrong witness, not a wrong recurrence.
* **Each level, against the images themselves.** Sampled, because it inflates:
  `sigma^k(i)` and `sigma^k(j)` are built by substituting and scanned for a
  position where the prefixes carry one Parikh vector and the letters agree.
  Nothing in it touches the automaton, the incidence matrix or the Perron
  field, and it must find one at the reported level and none below it. This is
  the check with no shared step, which is why it is stated apart from the one
  above rather than folded into it.
* **Each level, against the overlap graph.** A left-aligned non-coincidence
  vertex `(i, j, 0)` of the seed-patch overlap automaton is productive exactly
  when the pair is eventually coincident, and its first-coincidence depth is
  the least number of inflations that reaches one. That depth and the shortest
  witness are computed from different objects -- exact cubic tile geometry on
  one side, an integer Parikh difference on the other -- and must agree. This
  one *is* sampled, because building the graph is what costs, and the two
  counts are reported apart so a reader can see which claim covers what.

The exploration carries no budget outcome: its state set is finite by the
argument in `psc.coincidence_formula`, so a cap is a guard against a defect in
that file and exceeding it raises. This driver catches nothing, so anything
that raises aborts the census rather than being counted as an inconclusive
specimen.

Deciding the condition per specimen is not deciding it for the family. Strong
coincidence for alphabet-3 Pisot substitutions is open, and a clean sweep here
is elimination of counterexamples over a finite corpus and nothing more.
