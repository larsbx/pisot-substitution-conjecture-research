"""Exploratory: what happens where short-prefix overlap-type inclusion fails?

`oa_type_inclusion_census.mojo` finds, for each sampled specimen, the least
prefix length `k <= KMAX` giving type inclusion of the Sirvent--Solomyak
overlap types into the seed-patch vertex types. This driver takes the
specimens where no such `k` exists and asks three further questions:

* does a longer prefix, up to `EXTENDED_KMAX`, give inclusion?
* does another fixed point do, over every prolongable `(q, c)`?
* is the union of every probed family productive, and how does it sit
  against the seed patch?

A nonproductive type in any probed family is the event worth keeping, and is
printed before any aggregate. Everything here is exploratory: level-zero types
are read off a finite prefix, an uncertified factor set, so a failure of
inclusion is not a mathematical obstruction and a success is not a theorem.
