"""Exact census: first left-aligned depth against the contracting lower bound.

For every alphabet-3 PIP substitution with images of length at most 3, builds
the seed-patch overlap graph, computes the first left-aligned depth `b` of
every vertex (`psc.overlap_seed_patch`) and the contracting lower bound `m_0`
of manuscript Proposition 5.42 (`psc.overlap_contracting`), checks `m_0 <= b`
on every vertex and `m_0 = 0` exactly at offset zero, and reports the
distributions of `m_0` and of the excess `b - m_0`.  A nonproductive graph is
recorded before any depth statistic.  The Python oracle
`scripts/overlap_contracting_census.py` prints the same summary lines (all
but the specimen-count header).
