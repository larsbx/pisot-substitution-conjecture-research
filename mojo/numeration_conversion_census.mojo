"""Conversion automata over the corpus, each verified on a bounded domain.

For every sampled specimen: build the automaton relating Dumont-Thomas path
words to digit words of the linear numeration, and check it against the
positions it claims to relate. Every position below the bound must pair with
its own digit word and with no nearby other; where the conversion is small
enough to carry the letter map across, the transferred map must answer exactly
as reading the fixed point does.

The same three outcomes are kept apart as in the addition census. A built and
verified conversion is finite evidence about that specimen. A construction past
the state cap is a refusal, not a negative: the imported theorem says a finite
state set exists, and this exploration did not find one inside the cap. A
specimen skipped -- for a digit alphabet larger than the cap, or for a
conversion too large to project through -- was never attempted, and the two
reasons are counted apart because they say different things. No conversion in
this corpus is currently too large: every one that builds also carries its
letter map across.

This driver catches nothing. A refusal arrives as a flag on the result;
anything that raises aborts the census rather than being counted as an
inconclusive specimen.

Nothing here decides a coincidence condition or moves a ledger entry
(`docs/automatic-sequence-route-literature-gate-2026-09-17.md`).
