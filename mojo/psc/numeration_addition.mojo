"""Addition in the numeration a substitution carries, as a finite automaton.

A decision procedure over an automatic sequence needs three automata: the one
saying which digit words are admissible, the one giving the letter at a
position, and the one recognising

    { (x, y, z) : val(x) + val(y) = val(z) }

over digit triples. The first two are in `psc.dumont_thomas`. This module
builds the third.

The construction is the one the Pisot property licenses, carried out here as
exact integer state exploration. Read a triple most significant first and let
`s = x + y - z` at each position. The running difference is kept as a vector
`v` over the window `(U_(j+2), U_(j+1), U_j)`, so that

    sum over i >= j of s_i U_i  =  v0 U_(j+2) + v1 U_(j+1) + v2 U_j

and moving the window down one place, with
`U_(j+3) = -c2 U_(j+2) - c1 U_(j+1) - c0 U_j`, turns that into

    v <- (v1 - c2 v0,  v2 - c1 v0,  -c0 v0 + s)

which is the transition. A word is accepted when what is left evaluates to
zero: `v0 U_2 + v1 U_1 + v2 U_0 = 0`. Padding with `(0, 0, 0)` fixes the zero
state, so leading zeros neither add nor remove an acceptance.

Without pruning that exploration diverges, and it must: the window step is
multiplication by the expanding root, so the coefficients of a state that can
never be completed grow without bound. What keeps the set finite is the
Pisot property, applied as a *reachability* test rather than assumed: the
digits still to come can only contribute so much, so a state whose value
already exceeds that reserve can never be completed to zero and is sent to a
rejecting sink. The comparison is exact -- the value is a cubic element and
`sign_at_perron` decides its sign at the Perron root by Sturm-Tarski counting,
with no float anywhere.

The bound is deliberately generous. Pruning too little only adds states, which
the cap catches; pruning too much would drop a true triple, so the regression
checks acceptance on every sum below a stated bound rather than trusting the
constant.

That the reachable set is finite at all is the content of the imported theorem
(`docs/automatic-sequence-route-literature-gate-2026-09-17.md`), not of this
code. So the exploration carries a cap, and exceeding it is an *outcome*, not
an error: `AdditionResult` carries it as a refusal, the way a bounded search in
this repository reports an exhausted budget. Malformed input still raises,
because that is an impossible state rather than an inconclusive search, and the
two must not reach a caller through the same channel -- a caller that caught
both would be free to report a defect as inconclusive evidence.

An automaton returned here is a construction whose boundedness was observed on
this input, never a proof that addition is recognisable in general.
