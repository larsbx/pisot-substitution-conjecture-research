"""Tier-2 exact gain fixtures built from existing PSC overlap machinery.

This module is an adapter, not a spectral theorem.

The first channel exported here is 'affine_forcing': for an ordered overlap
occurrence with exact recurrence

    w' = beta*w + q - p,

the edge gain is the cubic field element q - p already stored as
AffineOccurrenceEdge.forcing.

No claim is made that 'affine_forcing' is the Penrose exact-prefix cocycle
Phi from the Growth Bridge notes. A future Penrose adapter must name that
channel separately and prove its own interpretation.

Fixtures retain occurrence multiplicity and global overlap-state indices.
Only edges whose source and target both lie in the selected component are
included. Capped graphs are rejected.
