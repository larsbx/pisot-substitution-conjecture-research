"""A degree-`n` Pisot screen, exact and fail-closed.

`psc.pisot` decides the Pisot condition for degree three only, and it does so
with a cubic-specific trick: for one real root and one conjugate pair,
`beta * |beta_2|^2 = det`, so the pair sits inside the unit disc exactly when
`chi(det) < 0`. That identity does not generalise, so degree four and above
needs a different method.

The method here works at any degree. Send the unit circle to the imaginary axis
by the Moebius substitution

    z = (1 + w) / (1 - w),      q(w) = (1 - w)^n p((1 + w) / (1 - w)),

under which `|z| < 1` becomes `Re(w) < 0` and `|z| > 1` becomes `Re(w) > 0`.
Then count right-half-plane roots of `q` with a Routh array over exact
rationals. `z = -1` maps to `w = infinity`, which shows up as a degree drop in
`q`, and `z = 1` maps to `w = 0`; both are settled before the array is built.

Every value is a `finite_exact` rational. No floating point is used anywhere,
and the polynomial helpers are shared with `psc.pisot` rather than repeated.

**A refusal is not a negative result, and it is not a positive one either.**
The array is undecided when a first-column entry vanishes or a row terminates
early. Those are the two classical Routh singularities and they do not mean the
same thing. A *vanishing row* is handled here by the auxiliary-derivative rule.
A *first-column zero in a row that is not itself zero* is a different
singularity, with its own classical remedies, and this module implements none
of them: it refuses. Such a refusal says only that this array did not resolve.

So `SCREEN_REFUSED` must not be read either way. `x^3 - 3x^2 - 3x - 3` is
refused here and is nevertheless a genuine Pisot polynomial: its image is
`4w^3 + 12w - 8`, whose second Routh row is `[0, -8]`, while its roots are
3.951... and a conjugate pair of modulus 0.871... . Its real part on the
imaginary axis is the constant `-8`, so it has no axis root at all. That bound
is recorded in the literature gate; see `known_first_column_refusal`.

The literature gate for this diagnostic is
`docs/pisot-screen-literature-gate-2026-09-16.md`; the Python oracle it was
differentially tested against is `src/psc_research/pisot_screen.py`.
