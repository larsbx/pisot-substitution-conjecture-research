"""Converting between the two numerations a substitution carries.

The route needs its automata to speak one numeration, and the two this
repository builds are not the same presentation. A Dumont-Thomas path digit
weighs a child block, whose length depends on the letters along the path; a
greedy digit weighs `U_j = |tau^j(c)|` alone. `agrees_with_path_digits` decides
per specimen whether they coincide, and over the sampled corpus they mostly do
not. So the letter map of `psc.dumont_thomas`, which is indexed by path digits,
and the addition relation of `psc.numeration_addition`, which is recognised
over greedy digits, cannot appear in one formula until something relates them.

This module is that something. It builds

    C = { (P, G) : P an admissible path word from `c`, |G| = |P|,
                   val_path(P) = val_greedy(G) }

as a synchronous two-track automaton, and then carries the letter map across
it: `greedy_letter_automaton` is the set of digit words whose value is a
position of the fixed point carrying a given letter. With that, the letter map
and addition live in the same numeration.

## The state is three integers, and the step is the incidence matrix

Write `L_m` for the vector `L_m(b) = |tau^m(b)|`. One substitution step is
exactly one level of it:

    L_(m+1)(b) = sum over t of L_m(tau(b)[t]) = sum over b' of M[b'][b] L_m(b')

so `L_(m+1) = M^T L_m` with `M` the incidence matrix. That identity is what
makes the state small. Read both tracks most significant first and let `A_j` be
the running difference after the step whose weights are at level `j`. Keep it
as a coefficient vector against the *current* level,

    A_j = x . L_j,

and one step down is then a matrix-vector product with integer entries:

    A_(j-1) = x . L_j + s . L_(j-1) = (M x + s) . L_(j-1),  so  x <- M x + s

where `s[b]` is what this step contributes at level `j-1`: the path digit `p`
skips the first `p` child blocks of `tau(a)`, contributing one `L_(j-1)` of
each letter it skips, and the greedy digit `g` subtracts `g` copies of
`L_(j-1)(c)`. The state carries `a`, the letter the path has reached, because
the next step's blocks are its image. An inadmissible path digit falls into the
rejecting sink, and since `L_0 = (1, 1, 1)` a word is accepted exactly when the
coordinates of `x` sum to zero.

The window of three levels that `psc.numeration_addition` keeps is the right
state there, where every weight is a shift of one sequence `U`. Here three
letters each carry their own weight, and a window of three levels times three
letters would be *nine* coefficients for a value with only three degrees of
freedom: the same difference would be reached in many representations, none of
which the exploration could identify, and it diverges rather than closing. The
identity above is what removes that redundancy.

## The pruning, and what it assumes

The step is multiplication by the incidence matrix, so without pruning the
exploration diverges for the honest reason: coefficients of a state that can
never be completed grow like the expanding root. The Pisot property bounds what
the digits still to come can contribute, so a state whose value is already past
that reserve is dead. The two contracting eigendirections stay bounded by
themselves -- that is the Pisot property doing the other half of the work -- and
the reserve bounds the third.

Measuring "past the reserve" needs the value as a real number, and the three
letters' weights are not commensurable: `L_m(b)` grows like `v_b beta^m` with
`v` the left Perron eigenvector, whose entries lie in `Z[beta]` and differ
between letters. So the test is exact rather than scalar.
`perron_tile_lengths_in` constructs and verifies that eigenvector in the same
cubic field, the value becomes the cubic element `sum_b x[b] v_b`, and
`sign_at_perron` decides the comparison by Sturm-Tarski counting. The reserve's
`1/(beta - 1)` is cleared by multiplying the comparison through by `beta - 1`,
which is positive, so no division enters. No float anywhere.

Like the bound in `psc.numeration_addition`, this one is deliberately generous:
the ratios are the limiting ones, exact for the eigenvector and only asymptotic
at a finite level, so pruning too little is the safe direction -- it adds
states, which the cap catches -- and the regressions check acceptance on every
position below a stated bound rather than trusting the constant.

That a finite state set exists at all is the imported theorem, gated in
`docs/automatic-sequence-route-literature-gate-2026-09-17.md`. Exceeding the
cap is therefore an outcome and not an error: `BoundedAutomaton` carries it as
a refusal. Malformed input still raises.

## What this is not

`C` relates a path word to *any* digit word of the same length with the same
value, not only to the greedy one. Greedy-normality is a separate language -- a
lexicographic condition against the expansion of one -- and it is not built
here, so `greedy_letter_automaton` accepts every representation of a position
carrying the letter, greedy or not. For a decision procedure that is the useful
side of the choice, since normalisation is its own automaton there too; for a
claim about digits it is a thing that has to be said.
