"""Overlap types of the Sirvent--Solomyak graph, compared with the seed patch.

For a fixed point `u` of a prolongable power `tau = sigma^q` and a prefix
`W = u[:k]`, the literature overlap graph `G_O(T, x(W))` has vertices the
overlap types of the tiling pair `(T, T - g(W))`. Its level-zero types are
read off the pair `(u, S^k u)`: the top tile at `g(u[:i])` and the bottom tile
at `g(u[:m]) - g(W)`, so the offset is the integer combination
`<l, pi(u[i:m]) - pi(W)>` of the exact tile lengths. Only tiles within a
window of each other can overlap, and the window is decided exactly in
`Q(beta)`: `n` consecutive tiles span at least `n * l_min`, while two
overlapping tiles lie within `g(W) + l_max` of each other.

Closing those level-zero types under inflation uses the same exact kernel as
the seed-patch graph (`psc.overlap_seed_patch`), so the two graphs are
comparable vertex by vertex. Productivity of an overlap depends only on its
type, so an inclusion `types(G_O) subset of types(O_sigma)` transfers
seed-patch productivity to the literature graph.

This is exploratory. The level-zero types come from a finite prefix of `u`,
which is an uncertified factor set: a computed inclusion is evidence about
that prefix, not a theorem about the whole tiling.
