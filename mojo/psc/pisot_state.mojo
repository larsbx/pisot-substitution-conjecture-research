"""The state a Pisot digit exploration carries, and the reserve that bounds it.

Two explorations in this repository carry the same state: the numeration
conversion and the coincidence automaton both accumulate `M x + s` while
reading digits most significant first, and both diverge unless states that can
no longer reach zero are cut. (`psc.numeration_addition` cuts the same way for
the same reason, but its state weighs shifts of one sequence rather than one
coefficient per letter, so its comparison is in a different basis and is not
this one.)

The state is a vector `x` of integers weighing quantities that grow like
`v_b beta^m`, where `v` is the left Perron eigenvector of the incidence matrix
and `beta` its Perron root. Its value at the Perron embedding is the cubic
element `sum_b x[b] v_b`, and what the remaining digits can still contribute is
bounded by a geometric series in `1/beta`. Clearing the series' `1/(beta - 1)`
by multiplying the comparison through by `beta - 1`, which is positive, leaves
an exact comparison between two elements of `Z[beta]` that `sign_at_perron`
decides by Sturm-Tarski counting. No division and no float enters.

`slack` is the caller's, not this module's. The bound here is
`slack (radix - 1) sum_b v_b`, and whether `slack = 1` is a theorem about the
caller's state or an estimate that has to be measured depends on whether the
caller's weights are exactly `v_b beta^m` or only asymptotically so. Each
caller states which, and the asymmetry is the same for all of them: pruning too
little adds states, which a cap catches; pruning too much drops a real answer,
which nothing catches.

The two together are what make the accumulation safe rather than merely
plausible: three columns of entries at most this large, against coordinates at
most `ENTRY_BOUND`, keep every intermediate under `193 * 2^52`, which is an
order of magnitude inside the machine range. Both are checked on the way in, so
the only unchecked quantity is the sum, which is checked on the way out.

This bound is the *matrix's* alone. A step's contribution is bounded by
`ENTRY_BOUND` like a coordinate, because it is one: a caller with a large digit
alphabet legitimately contributes more than an incidence entry ever holds, and
the arithmetic above has room for it."""
