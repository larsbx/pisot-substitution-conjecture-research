"""The input distribution of this repository's oracle layer, declared.

Round-three item R9: `larsbx/meta_test` requires a generator to declare a
codomain refinement, `phi_G`, as an object a run can refuse rather than an
accident of how the test was written. The facility is
`tools/oracle_refinement`, vendored from `larsbx/finite-math-kernels` and
specified in its `docs/generator-refinement-spec.md`.

This repository's differential oracles -- `scripts/overlap_depth_census_oracle.py`
and the census scripts beside it -- do not sample. They run over
`psc_research.pip_screen.pip_corpus()`, every PIP substitution on three letters
with image lengths at most three. That is the strongest distribution there is,
and declaring it is not therefore pointless: the finite-domain claims in
`claim_governance.toml` are asserted *for that domain and no other*, so what the
domain contains is part of every one of them. A sentence in a document saying
"the exact 4,554-member short-image corpus" is a number; this is the number, the
shape behind it, and a run that refuses when either moves.

The declaration says what the corpus is *like*. `DIGEST` says *which* corpus it
is, because the two are different guarantees: swap one member for a duplicate
of another and the count, the shape and every named class survive untouched
while the finite domain has quietly changed. The size and the classes catch a
screen that admits or rejects the wrong kind of substitution; the digest catches
a screen that admits or rejects the wrong ones.

Writing the declaration found something the name hides. The domain is described
as "image lengths at most three", and the corpus contains **no constant-length
substitution at all**: not one of `(1,1,1)`, `(2,2,2)` or `(3,3,3)`. A constant
image length `L` makes every column sum of the incidence matrix `L`, so `L` is a
rational eigenvalue and the characteristic polynomial is reducible; the
irreducibility screen rejects all 19,683 candidates of shape `(3,3,3)` before
the Pisot test is ever reached. That is why the widest total image length in the
corpus is eight rather than nine. A reader taking "lengths at most three" at
face value would assume the corner is in there. It is declared missed here, with
the reason, so the next reader does not have to rediscover it.

Usage:
    corpus_refinement.py            report phi_G
    corpus_refinement.py --check    exit 1 if the corpus departs from it
