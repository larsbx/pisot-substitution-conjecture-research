# Session probes behind the vertex-coincidence note — 2026-10-03/04

Every scratch probe run while working on
`docs/p1b-vertex-coincidence-box-2026-10-02.md` §§3–5.6 (PRs #197–#204 and
the PR that adds this archive), with its saved output. The probes were
written as throwaway scratch and are kept here unchanged, except that
absolute scratch paths were made relative. They are **provenance, not
canonical code** (AGENTS.md):

- the Python probes are floating-point or prototype oracles, not
  certificates;
- the Mojo probes are exact, but are superseded by the committed drivers
  named below;
- every claim in the note cites the committed Mojo driver where one exists.

`outputs/rerun_<name>.out` is a fresh re-run of every probe on 2026-10-04
(`probes/rerun.sh`). The other files in `outputs/` are the logs saved during
the session. `evidence.zip` holds the bulky outputs (the length-4 census
chunk logs, the targeted-search chunk logs, `law.json` and the 135,990
`K_V` records). `SHA256SUMS` binds every file.

## Replay

```sh
cd archive/2026-10-04/session-probes
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS
unzip -o evidence.zip          # restores bulk/ (needed by uhan.py, law_stats.py)
cd probes && PIXI=pixi ./rerun.sh            # all probes; or ./rerun.sh NAME ...
python3 law_stats.py; python3 len4_rest.py   # written for this archive
```

The Python probes need only the standard library. `lib.py` is their shared
helper (float PIP screen, characteristic polynomial, roots). The Mojo probes
run against `mojo/` through `pixi run --manifest-path`.
